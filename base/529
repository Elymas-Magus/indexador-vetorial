	<abstract>We examined serum proteins from 18 CF subjects and 14 control
   individuals.  We were unable to detect any consistent differences
   between the stained serum protein patterns of the CF and the control
   subjects.  These patterns show greater resolution of proteins than
   those previously published, but, in contrast, no consistent
   differences between CF and control subjects.  In addition, we have
   modified the published methods with procedures which would enhance
   the likelihood of electrophoretic detection of an abnormal protein
   with the reported properties.  A portion of the samples analyzed by
   the published procedures also were analyzed by each of these
   modifications.  None of the modified procedures showed consistent
   differences between serum proteins from the CF and the control
   subjects.  No explanation is readily apparent for the difference
   between results of Thomas et al. and our own results on the one hand
   and the previously reported results on the other.  We attempted to
   rigorously reproduce the isoelectric focusing techniques given in the
   literature.  However, isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel can
   be affected by small technical differences and, thus, factors
   essential to reproducing the techniques may not have been evident in
   the published procedure.</abstract>
