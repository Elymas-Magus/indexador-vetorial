	<abstract>Professor Elliott and Dr Norman and his colleagues suggested that
   excessive wrinkling of the skin after soaking in tap water might
   provide an easy, cheap, and probably reliable screening test for
   cystic fibrosis.  Our results show that this not true.  Marked
   wrinkling after immersion of the fingers in warm tap water for 5
   minutes was observed in randomly selected children with a wide
   variety of conditions, including not only cystic fibrosis but also
   malnutrition and renal, heart, endocrine, collagen, and other
   diseases.  It was elicited even in apparently healthy individuals,
   both young and adult.</abstract>
