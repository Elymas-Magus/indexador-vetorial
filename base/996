	<abstract>Potential sources of error in the Gibson and Cooke method of sweat
   testing using gauze and filter paper as collection media as
   described. The absolute chloride content of gauze was higher than
   that of filter paper; however, the variability of chloride contents
   between the two was insignificant. Complete chloride elution from
   filter paper requires more time than elution from gauze. A method of
   determining probability of a clinically acceptable measurement based
   on sweat sample size, chloride determination, and variability of
   chloride in collection media is also described.</abstract>
