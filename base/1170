	<abstract>We focused our study on concentration of immunoglobulins, lysozyme,
   lactoferrin, some antiproteolytic fractions and acute phase proteins
   in bronchial secretion of children with various pulmonary diseases,
   especially with cystic fibrosis.  Secretory IgA is decreased in all
   studied groups of patients having chronic or recurrent infections of
   the respiratory tract (when compared to the group of healthy
   children).  Groups which were characterized by the infection of the
   lower part of the respiratory tract had increased lysozyme level.
   The results obtained in the group of CF children are similar to those
   obtained in groups with bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis, which
   suggests that the observed differences are characteristic for chronic
   infection rather than for CF.  Although in CF as well as in
   bronchiectasis massive bacterial infection results in increased
   concentration of immunoglobulins, antiproteolytic fractions and acute
   phase proteins, the results seen in both groups are somewhat
   different.  These differences may indicate some difference in the
   reactivity to infection of the respiratory tract in CF in comparison
   to patients with bronchiectasis.  It seems conceivable that among
   children with CF who have very low S-IgA, chronic respiratory tract
   infections occur earlier and IgG response to permanent exposition to
   variety of antigens is less vigorous.  The presented results raise
   also a possibility that the bacterial infection in CF does not
   stimulate defence mechanisms to the same extent as in bronchiectasis.</abstract>
