	<abstract>Alpha-amylase activity and protein concentration of cystic fibrosis
   (CF), obligate heterozygote (H), and normal (N) saliva have been
   evaluated with respect to genotype, age, sex and clinical status.
   &quot;Factors&quot; present in CF saliva had no detectable effect on salivary
   amylase activity under reaction conditions optimized for both
   competitive and noncompetitive inhibition.  Tris
   [tris-(hydoxy-methyl)aminomethane] inhibited amylase activity with a
   Ki = 59 plus or minus 10 mM, but CF &quot;factors&quot; had no detectable
   effect on either substrate or Tris binding to alpha-amylase.
   Alpha-amylase concentrationand protein content of CF saliva had
   bimodal distributions.  Thirty-six percent of the CF patients were
   found to be amylase hypersecretors, with amylase concentration 3 or
   more SD above the N mean.  Amylase hypersecretion was marginally
   correlated with both genetic factors (with parent values, P = 0.075)
   and clinical status (with Scwachman scores, P = 0.068).  All the
   hypersecretors were in the 14-24 year age group.  Amylase
   concentration for this age was significant higher in CF samples
   (mean plus or minus SD), 82 plus or minus 37 starch units/ml (n = 
   12), than in N samples, 33 plus or minus 17 starch unites/ml (n =
   13), as measured by the Student t-test (P &lt; 0.001).  Salivary
   protein content of 14- to 24-year-old CF males was elevated compared
   to all other groups [1.57 plus or minus 0.76 (n = 5) vs. 0.63 plus
   or minus  0.47 (n = 20); Student t-test, P &lt; 0.005].  Mean specific
   activity of male saliva dropped sharply as age increased from 10-15
   years, from over 200 to less than 75 starch units/mg protein.  Mean
   normal female specific activity values were essentially constant [97
   plus or minus 50 (n = 18) starch units/mg protein] from 5-30 years
   of age.  CF male specific activity values decreased similarly to the
   N male values from preadolescence to adolescence, but the mean CF
   female values peaked later, at 17 years, with a maximum of 171 plus
   or minus 58 (n = 4).  This is significantly higher than all the
   other groups in the 16- to 20-year age range: 63 plus or minus 30 (n
   = 9), P &lt; 0.005.  These data emphasize the need for age- and
   sex-matched controls in all studies of salivary composition.  We
   were unable to detect any effect of a salivary CF factor on the
   enzymatic activity of alpha-amylase.  Hypersecretion of salivary
   alpha-amylase was observed in 36% of CF patients.  This may reflect
   alterations in secretory function basic to CF, or be secondary to
   the disease process and result from decreased secretion from the
   mucous salivary glands or deterioration of pancreatic function.</abstract>
