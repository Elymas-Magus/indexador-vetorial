	<abstract>In three literature reports the linoleic acid (L.A.) levels for
   cystic fibrosis (C.F.) compared to controls are always more
   significantly lower than arachidonic acid (A.A.).  Similarly the
   percentage lowering is also more for L.A. than A.A.  There is, thus,
   no &quot;overwhelming&quot; evidence for a blocked or absent desaturase and
   the cause of the E.F.A. deficiency must be elsewhere.  We have found
   up to 2.5% of the total fatty acids in both serum and red cells to
   be C20:3-omega-9.  All of our C.F. patients have shown this acid at
   some stage and, for most, it is a permanent feature of their fatty
   acid profile.  It has been reported that C20:3-omega-9 would
   probably act as an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation from A.A.
   and it is interesting to conjecture on whether this could account
   for some of the symptoms of C.F.  C20:3-omega-9 would also be
   incorporated into P.I. and could then alter membrane properties.</abstract>
