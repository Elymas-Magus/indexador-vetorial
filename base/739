	<abstract>In a previous communication, written in response to a letter by
   Smith et al., we suggested several possible reasons for the
   inability of Thomas et al. and other investigators to detect cystic
   fibrosis protein (CFP) using electrofocusing techniques.  Thomas and
   coworkers communicated with us for the purpose of determining
   possible reasons for their inability to detect CFP by
   electrofocusing.  Key points made during these conversations are
   reiterated below in a firm attempt to alleviate future problems by
   inexperienced investigators in their attempts to use analytic
   electrofocusing to detect CFP.  In our communications with Thomas
   and coworkers we learned that, despite our suggestions, they had not
   analyzed the samples they screened by either using the equipment of
   Awdeh et al. or employing our standardized procedure.  It is unknown
   whether or not they exercised the requirements for serum sample
   collection, processing, and storage.  We feel the above reasons are
   sufficient to explain the reported failure of Thomas et al. to
   reproduce our results and to detect consistently a CFP in sera from
   individuals with the CF gene.</abstract>
