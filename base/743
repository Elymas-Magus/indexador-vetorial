	<abstract>The key enzymes in the synthesis of the naturally occurring
   polyamines, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosyl methionine
   (SAM) decarboxylase, were investigated during cell growth and aging
   in fibroblast cultures from normal patients and patients with cystic
   fibrosis. A linear correlation between increased S-adenosyl
   methionine activity and putrescine concentration was apparent in all
   cell lines. A putrescine concentration of 0.8 mM was optimal for
   enhancement of SAM decarboxylase activity. The passage number of the
   cell line correlated inversely with maximal putrescine-stimulated SAM
   decarboxylase activity, earlier passage numbers having the highest
   specific activity (Fig. 1). No significant differences in basal or
   putrescine-stimulated SAM decarboxylase activity were noted between
   normal fibroblast cultures and cells from patients with cystic
   fibrosis (Fig. 2). SAM decarboxylase activity increased as the cell
   lines approached confluence. Activity was lowest during exponential
   growth (Fig. 3). ODC activity was increased during early exponential
   growth and fell as cells reached confluence (Fig. 4). No differences
   in ODC activity and putrescine inhibition between the normal and
   cystic fibrosis cell cultures at equivalent points of exponential
   growth were noted.</abstract>
