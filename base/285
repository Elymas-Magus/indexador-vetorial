	<abstract>In a recent study, we attempted to assess the personality
   characteristics of both mothers and fathers of children with cystic
   fibrosis.  In all, more than 150 such parents were interviewed.
   During the course of the interview, the Taylor manifest anxiety
   scale, Fouldes&apos; personality inventory, and the 16 PF test form A
   were used.  It was apparent that these parents represented a wide
   range of personality types, and differed in no way from the general
   population.</abstract>
