	<abstract>Serum from 95 patients with cystic fibrosis and 47 control subjects
   without cystic fibrosis was analyzed for carboxypeptidase B-like
   activity in the presence of optimal concentrations of Co2+ ion,
   hippuryl-L-lysine and serum.  Fourteen of the cystic fibrosis
   patients had no steatorrhea and therefore minimal pancreatic
   dysfunction.  Patients with cystic fibrosis and controls were of
   comparable age.  Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity was
   significantly decreased in cystic fibrosis patients including cystic
   fibrosis patients without steatorrhea.  Significantly low values
   were found in both male and female cystic fibrosis patients when
   compared with controls of similar sex.  Although values were
   unaffected by age in the control population, values in older
   patients with cystic fibrosis were significantly lower than values
   in younger patients.  No correlation was obtained between serum
   carboxypeptidase B-like activity and pulmonary or hepatic function.
   Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity therefore falls with
   progression of the disease and may limit the ability to degrade
   circulating peptides in older patients with cystic fibrosis.
   Deficient serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity is less likely,
   however, to be a factor in the development of the early
   manifestations of the disease.</abstract>
