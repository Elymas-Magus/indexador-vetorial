	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis is one of the most frequent of the serious chronic
   diseases of childhood and adolescence and is the most common genetic
   disease among Caucasian children.  Medical research and home
   treatment programs have greatly improved the outlook for these
   children.  The nursing profession has played a significant role in
   this progress at home, the hospital, the school, and the community.
   Our goal is to teach the treatments that may help maintain the
   health of these children for as long as possible and, in the face of
   this, to help them and their families to lead as normal a life as
   possible.</abstract>
