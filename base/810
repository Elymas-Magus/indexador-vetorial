	<abstract>A pilot study has examined the effect of cimetidine on steatorrhea in
   children with pancreatic insufficiency due to CF who were receiving
   pancreatic supplements.  Administration of cimetidine with pancreatic
   supplements reduced the faecal fat excretion in 4 out of 5 children,
   in 3 cases by more than 50%.  In Case 4 steatorrhea increased on
   cimetidine but without any symptoms and we have no explanation for
   it.  None of the children had any side effects from the drug.
   Further studies are needed to determine the indications of cimetidine
   in the dietary management of CF.</abstract>
