	<abstract>It has always seemed to me that the use of the Exercise Lability
   Index (ELI) distorts results and may be misleading because a falsely
   high value for lability is obtained when the PEF at rest is low.  It
   is incorrect to compare percentage values from such patients with
   percentage values from those with figures at rest which are near to
   normal.  The Jones Liability Index avoids this distortion.  I do not
   suggest that a proportion of CF patients do not have abnormal
   lability but would maintain that the ELI introduces inaccuracy which
   may blur the distinction between CF and other respiratory conditions
   and may lead to the postulation of problems concerning lability in
   CF which do not necessarily exist.  Failure to use a bronchodilator
   agent to reinforce brief exercise may also cause distortion but in
   the opposite direction.</abstract>
