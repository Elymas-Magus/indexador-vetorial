	<abstract>The control of symptoms in dying children is often sadly neglected.
   This neglect is reflected in a review of the case notes of two
   children who died of cystic fibrosis within three years of each
   other.  The girls were under the care of the same consultant, who in
   the interval between the two cases was introduced to the concept of
   proper terminal care for children.  These two cases show that illness
   can cause physical, emotional, and spiritual pain to family and
   staff.  In retrospect these areas of distress were not clearly
   defined in either case and opportunities to alleviate suffering were
   missed.  The principles of controlling symptoms need to be remembered
   as much during distressing treatment as during the distress of dying.</abstract>
