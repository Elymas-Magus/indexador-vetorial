	<abstract>Long considered a childhood disease, cystic fibrosis has been
   recognized with increasing frequency in adults.  In the case reported
   below the diagnosis was made in an adult.  The initial diagnosis of
   cystic fibrosis in patients over 30 years of age has rarely been
   reported.  Our patient, in whom the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was
   first made at 48 years if age, serves to emphasize the point that
   physicians should consider cystic fibrosis in the differential
   diagnosis of adults with unexplained chronic obstructive lung
   disease.</abstract>
