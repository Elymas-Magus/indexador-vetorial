	<abstract>We examined the age dependence of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
   (SACE) activity in healthy controls.  While we found no age
   dependence in controls older than 20 years, those under 20 had much
   increased SACE values.  We feel that it is inappropriate to evaluate
   SACE activity in patients under 20 years old with diagnostic criteria
   determined in adults. - Dr Romer and colleagues reported high
   activities of SACE in 3 patients out of 10 with chronic granulomatous
   disease (CGD) and concluded that &quot;CGD is associated with increased
   levels of SACE&quot;.  Unfortunately, Romer et al. did not study an
   adequate paedeatric age control group, and their mean values are
   compared primarily with that in 5 children with cystic fibrosis.  Our
   most recent studies confirm our earlier observation that children
   under the age 19 years definitely have higher mean SACE values than
   do adults.  Cystic-fibrosis patients should not be used for
   comparison since they tend to have lower SACE levels than comparable
   aged controls.  In my opinion patients with CGD, according to the
   data published by Romer et al., show no increase in SACE levels for
   their age.</abstract>
