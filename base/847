	<abstract>Properties of carboxypeptidase A of cultured skin fibroblasts from
   control and cystic fibrosis patients were studied using alpha-N-
   carbobenzoxy-L-glutamyl-L-tyrosine as substrate. Carboxypeptidase A
   was inhibited by thiomersal, cyanide, iodoacetate and N-
   ethylmaleimide in a similar manner for control and cystic fibrosis
   fibroblasts. Both trypsin and dithiothreitol treatment activated the
   enzyme, but 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited only in the presence of
   dithiothreitol. Both Zn2+ and Co2+ reversed this inhibition. Trypsin
   treatment of carboxypeptidase A produced a form of the enzyme having
   a higher KM value for both control and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.
   Dithiothreitol treatment of control fibroblasts resulted in a form
   with similar properties to the trypsin activated form, but cystic
   fibrosis fibroblasts yielded a variant form with even higher KM and
   Vmax values. Since other properties were similar, it seems likely
   that this difference reflected binding of a molecule to the enzyme
   rather than of a defect in the enzyme.</abstract>
