	<abstract>In an 8-year period, a programme of screening for cystic fibrosis has
   been conducted over an extensive part of Wales.  The screening method
   used is based on the detection of a high level of albumen (greater
   than 20 mg%) in the meconium.  During the course of the
   investigations several different tests have been used.  Because of
   the high incidence of false-negative results (34%) the detection of
   protein in meconium is not an ideal screening test, but is the most
   satisfactory presently available, in the newborn period.  Because of
   its relative simplicity, low cost, absence of direct involvement of
   the parent or patient, and a high yield of positive cases, its use on
   a wider scale may be justified.</abstract>
