	<abstract>A 22-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis was treated by volume-
   controlled lavage of each of her lungs on two occasions. Following
   the first lavages, the patient&apos;s vital capacity increased by 1.03
   liters and her 1-sec forced expiratory volume increased by 0.70
   liters/second. Similar improvements, although less pronounced, were
   noted after both lungs has been lavaged a second time. It is
   concluded that volume-controlled lung lavage can be of benefit as an
   adjunct in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
