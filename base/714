	<abstract>Increased sodium concentration in sweat is a characteristic of cystic
   fibrosis.  However, we have read nothing on the sodium content of
   breast milk in this condition.  A patient with sweat-test-proved
   cystic fibrosis with mild pulmonary disease had her first baby by
   normal delivery at term.  Samples of breast milk were obtained on the
   sixth and seventh days post partum when the mother was not breast
   feeding.  The two sodium concentrations were 132 and 280 mmol/l,
   concentrations much higher than in any other milk sample tested at
   this hospital in a large survey and higher than any we have seen in
   the literature.  Milk of such high sodium content would be unsafe for
   a baby, and we suggest that, if mothers with cystic fibrosis were to
   breast feed, the sodium of the mild should be measured first.  The
   breast, like so many other exocrine glands, seems to be affected by
   the secretory abnormalities of cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
