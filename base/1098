	<abstract>A 5-month-old white girl was admitted to an Infant Intensive Care
   Unit of Jackson Memorial Hospital.  According to her mother, the baby
   had been in &quot;her usual state of health&quot; until one week before
   admission, when she began to &quot;spit up&quot; after feedings and her lower
   extremities became puffy.  Vomiting increased in frequency until it
   occurred after every meal; eventually the baby refused all feedings;
   there was no diarrhea.  Ultimately, the family&apos;s physician, when
   consulted, recommended that she be admitted to the hospital.  On the
   fourth day she developed renal failure with anuria and rising
   creatinine concentration despite adequate fluid intake; peritoneal
   dialysis was begun.  However, she soon became hypothermic and
   developed pulmonary edema, and she died a few hours later.  A
   discussion of the case is presented.</abstract>
