	<abstract>The major issue is not the &quot;lack of interest of clinical chemists,&quot;
   but the actual performance of the test.  Neither the pathologist nor
   the clinical chemist, in all likelihood, actually performs the test.
   Rather, it is the medical technologist or technician who carries out
   the actual procedure.  It is a major part of our roles as educators
   and laboratory administrators to ensure that these people are
   adequately trained for the task and that the test meets high enough
   performance standards to provide a clinically relevant answer.</abstract>
