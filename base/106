	<abstract>In preliminary studies of short-term leukocyte cultures using
   Na2-35SO4 incorporation into cetyl-pyridinium-chloride
   (C.P.C.)-precipitable material (presumably glycosaminoglycans,
   G.A.G.), we have found significant variation among C.F. patients
   and their parents (obligate heterozygotes).  This biochemical
   heterogeneity is comparable to what has been reported in fibroblast
   cultures and serum.  The amount of Na2-35SO4 incorporated into
   G.A.G. material found in both the incubation medium and the cells
   from C.F. patients is significantly increased over normals.  A
   similar analysis between normals and heterozygotes shows no
   significant difference in Na2-35SO4 incorporation into G.A.G.
   material of the cells.  However, 4 out of 6 heterozygotes appeared
   to show a pattern of increased incorporation into material found in
   the incubation medium (indicated by a higher mean than the normal
   donors).  These results suggest yet another system to study the
   effects of the C.F. gene.  The incorporation of Na2-35SO4 into
   G.A.G. material of C.F. leukocyte cultures gives additional
   evidence for the genetic heterogeneity in this disorder.</abstract>
