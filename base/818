	<abstract>Bray et al. conclude that the mass screening of newborn babies with
   chloride ion-selective electrodes is a feasible method for the
   diagnosis of cystic fibrosis; they also suggest that this procedure
   might be used in conjunction with meconium analysis to reduce the
   incidence of false positive results.  In 1972 we reported the details
   of a child with proved cystic fibrosis in whom raised sweat sodium
   but normal sweat chloride levels were obtained during treatment with
   cloxacillin.  Attention was drawn to the implication of the finding
   with regard to screening procedures, and the suggestion was made
   that, in at least some children with cystic fibrosis, the cloxacillin
   radical might replace the chloride ion in the sweat.  When mass
   screening for cystic fibrosis is to be undertaken using methods based
   on the estimation of sweat chloride levels, it is therefore prudent
   to inquire whether the infant is receiving medication from any source
   and, if so, to interpret the results with caution. - These are
   instances of false-negative sweat chloride readings, but there is no
   evidence yet from our 1205 tests of any negative cystic fibrosis
   sweat chloride; the statistical chance of this is in any case small.
   These several cases suggest a need for a systematic investigation of
   the effect of medication on sweat ion levels in general as well as in
   cystic fibrosis cases.</abstract>
