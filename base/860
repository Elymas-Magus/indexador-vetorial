	<abstract>The large number and wide variety of precipitins detected in the
   sputum of cystic fibrosis patients suggest that the precipitins may
   be nonprotective and even harmful to the patients.  These sputum
   precipitins were directed principally against food, fungi, bacteria,
   and human body tissue.  On the other hand, precipitins to
   Staphylococcus alpha-hemolysin was the main type of immunoprecipitin
   detected in CF serum and was found in 60% of the serum specimens
   examined.  It seems likely that the precipitins in patients with CF
   may be involved in the formation of immune complexes which, in
   conjunction with complement, may be responsible for the respiratory
   and gastrointestinal lesions that are common in patients with CF.
   The immune complexes may be the result of excess food and bacterial
   antigens escaping across the gut and lungs as a result of some
   abnormality of the SIgA system.  Over 80% of the sputum specimens
   tested gave positive precipitins in agar gel against human seminal
   fluid and colostrum, suggesting that some of the antibodies formed in
   CF patients could be directed against host tissue, and may account
   for an autoimmune-type reaction in CF.  Crossreaction between the
   high-titer antibody to Staphylococcus and basement membrane of lungs
   and pancreas, with complement activation, may occur in CF and
   required further study.  The high number of B-cells, as detected by
   antibody, coated complement, activated sheep erythrocytes, and EAC
   rosettes, may be partly responsible for the synthesis of the variety
   of antibodies detected in CF patients.</abstract>
