	<abstract>This paper is a report on the first part of a comprehensive research
   programme.  The aim is the development of a mechanical aid which will
   enable patients with cystic fibrosis to give themselves satisfactory
   physiotherapy.  The percussor, which can be used by patients, parents
   or relatives, is portable and lightweight.  The domiciliary trial
   showed that effective percussion could be self-administered to the
   front of the chest and to a lesser extent to the sides of the chest.
   The percussor was found to be very acceptable to adolescent patients
   and especially girls with early breast development.  Further research
   work has now been completed and as a result a system has been
   developed which enables patients to treat themselves with
   satisfactory chest percussion in the five preferred positions of
   postural drainage.</abstract>
