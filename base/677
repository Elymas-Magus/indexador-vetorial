	<abstract>Sweat chloride of 25 healthy adults was tested by iontophoresis
   method as a control.  The mean value was 27.4 plus or minus 15.4
   mEq./l.  Thirty-six adult patients of bronchiectasis proved by
   bronchography was investigated for mucoviscidosis.  If a patient had
   sweat chloride above 60 mEq./l., it was considered to be diagnostic
   of mucoviscidosis.  Five (13.9 per cent) of 36 adult bronchiectasis
   patients had mucoviscidosis.  The mean value of sweat chloride in 31
   adult bronchiectasis patients was 32.9 plus or minus 11.7 mEq./l.
   The mean value of sweat chloride in 36 adult bronchiectasis patients
   (including 5 mucoviscidosis patients) was 42.3 plus or minus 26.8
   mEq./l.  Of 36 patients 18 had cylindrical type and 18 had saccular
   type of bronchiectasis.  Three (16.6 per cent) out of 18 cylindrical
   type of bronchiectasis patients and 2 (11.1 per cent) of 18 saccular
   type of bronchiectasis patients had mucoviscidosis.  Five (13.9 per
   cent) patients had emphysema and 6 (16.6 per cent) patients had
   emphysema with cor pulmonale.  One patient of each group had
   mucoviscidosis.  ECG showed P-pulmonale in 3 (8.3 per cent) patients
   one of whom had mucoviscidosis.  Only one mucoviscidosis patient had
   coagulase positive Staph. aureus in sputum.</abstract>
