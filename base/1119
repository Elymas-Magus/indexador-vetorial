	<abstract>During the 14 yr from 1965 through 1978, 49 infants presented shortly
   after birth with intestinal obstruction due to impacted meconium.
   Three of these patients did not have fibrocystic disease. Eight
   patients were cured by a Gastrografin enema. There were 18 patients
   who had complications that included associated atresia, volvulus,
   and/or peritonitis. Various operations were done including resection
   with either primary anastomosis or enterostomy or varieties of the
   foregoing. Twenty-three babies had the simple uncomplicated form of
   meconium ileus. Eleven of these underwent resection and six patients
   died. Twelve patients were treated by laparotomy, ileotomy through a
   purse-string suture and prolonged irrigations using acetylcysteine.
   Of this group only one succumbed. This latter course of management is
   recommended for patients with simple uncomplicated meconium ileus as
   it involves no resection, no enterostomy, nor any primary
   anastomosis.</abstract>
