	<abstract>We have used ion-specific electrodes in an attempt to map the sodium
   and chloride activities on the skin under differing surface
   conditions. The range of values and the standard deviations are so
   wide that a baseline for the untreated dry skin is precluded. In
   patients with cystic fibrosis, a wide range of values is also found.
   For this group, measurements on dry skin taken immediately after
   washing were in the same low range as for healthy subjects. The range
   of measurements on the dry skin of newborn infants was similar for
   full-term infants with reactive sweat glands and for premature
   infants who failed to show sweating responsiveness to natural reflex
   stimulation as well as local glandular stimulation with sudorific
   drugs. For only two conditions have measurements of sodium and
   chloride activities on the surface of the skin been of value: (1) on
   the sweat-covered skin for the detection of the high values
   encountered in cystic fibrosis, and (2) on the dry skin surface,
   deprived of autonomic innervation (spinal paraplegia), extremely low
   sodium and chloride activities reflect absent gland activity.</abstract>
