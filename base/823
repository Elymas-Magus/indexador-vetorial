	<abstract>Five children with cystic fibrosis were given repeated intravenous
   infusions of soya oil emulsion (Intralipid) for 12 to 18 months and
   the effects on growth, health, sweat chloride and pancreatic enzyme
   activity compared with a control group.  No beneficial effect was
   demonstrated and it is recommended that this form of therapy has no
   place in the routine treatment of children with cystic fibrosis.  It
   is possible that treatment may have modified the degree of weight
   loss noted after 12 months of age.  The lack of other beneficial
   effects and the problems involved in long-term Intralipid infusion
   should preclude the use of this form of therapy in the routine
   treatment of children with cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
