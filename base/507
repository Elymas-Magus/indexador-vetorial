	<title>Letter: Cystic fibrosis: description and genetics.</title>

	<abstract>It is regrettable that the excellent article by Bowman and Mangos on
   cystic fibrosis should be marred by a minor, yet unfortunately
   common, error.  The risks of producing a child with cystic fibrosis
   in Table 1 would have been essentially correct if they had been
   stated in fractional terms.  They are, however, stated in odds forms,
   and therefore understatements of the true risks.  The risk when both
   parents are known to be heterozygous, for example, is stated as 1:4.
   This would mean that the second alternative has four times as much
   likelihood of occurring as the first, and it is clearly not true.
   When both parents are heterozygous the odds are three times as likely
   that the child will be normal as affected.  This is usually stated as
   a risk of 1/4, or 1:3, that the child will be affected.</abstract>
