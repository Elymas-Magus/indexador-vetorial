	<abstract>Lysosomal acid hydrolases and alkaline phosphatase cooperate in the
   intracellular digestion of natural polymers.  A stimulus for the
   induction of these enzymes is the retention of any kind of polymer
   inside the cell.  This stimulus is long-lasting and strong if
   polymers are intracellularly retained because of a lack of digestive
   enzymes.  In previous papers it has been demonstrated that the
   alkaline phosphatase (AIP) induction with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein
   discriminates between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes on the one hand
   and normals and CF carriers on the other hand, and a hypothesis has
   been proposed to explain these observations.  As predicted, more
   efficient inducing mixtures have since been developed; these have
   been used in the present study.  The first writer familiarized
   himself with ultramicrotechniques and then carried out double blind
   studies on 20 fibroblast cultures from French patients.  These
   findings demonstrate the reproducibility of the AIP induction and of
   the methods used, and they particularly underline the importance of
   employing the present ultramicrotechniques for a successful AIP
   induction.  It is likely that amniotic fluid cells behave like skin
   fibroblasts in this test; if this proves to be so, then the induction
   of alkaline phosphatase should provide a useful technique for the
   prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
