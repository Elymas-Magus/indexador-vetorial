	<abstract>The University of Kansas group have established that pancreatic
   extracts, in the doses currently used in the management of patients
   with cystic fibrosis, cause hyperuricosuria which may occasionally be
   symptomatic.  They correctly worry about long-term ill effects of
   such therapy.  In treated CF patients the uricosuria results
   primarily from the increased dietary purine load, though the abnormal
   transport physiology in CF may contribute.  Even though final
   evidence on risk is not at hand, prudence would suggest holding the
   purine load in CF patients to the minimum needed to ensure digestion
   of sufficient foodstuffs without necessarily permitting a &quot;normal&quot;
   diet sans steatorrhea.  Alternatively, purified enzyme preparations
   free of the remaining sweetbread could eliminate the excess nucleic
   acid intake and be administered in a dosage permitting the luxury of
   redundant safety.</abstract>
