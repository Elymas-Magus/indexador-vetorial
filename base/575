	<abstract>Membrane function was examined in cultured cells from cystic fibrosis
   patients by assaying several enzymes on intact skin fibroblasts
   attached to culture dishes. This technique required few cells and
   minimized disruption of cellular organization. Comparison of enzyme
   activities of intact and broken cells showed that 12% of total
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, was
   measurable using intact cells, while all adenosine monophosphatase
   was measurable using intact cells. Alkaline
   paranitrophenylphosphatase activity was divided between the cell
   surface and interior. Substrate competition experiments indicated
   that substrate specificities for adenosine monophosphatase and
   paranitrophenylphosphatase activities were different. Adenosine
   monophosphatase activities of 2 control and 2 cystic fibrosis strains
   fluctuated similarly during the cell culture cycle. The apparent Km
   values relative to adenosine monophosphate were similar in all
   strains. A chromatographic fraction of serum from a cystic fibrosis
   patient that was inhibitory to oyster ciliary activity had no effect
   on adenosine monophosphatase activity of normal fibroblasts.
   Furthermore, fractions of media from cystic fibrosis homozygote and
   heterozygote fibroblast cultures were not inhibitory to adenosine
   monophosphatase activities of intact normal fibroblasts or of part
   iculate fractions prepared from them. In light of previous studies
   that showed that factors from cystic fibrosis serum of culture medium
   disrupted specific membrane activities, it is proposed that the
   cystic fibrosis factor interacts with the plasma membrane,
   interfering most conspicuously with the protein functions that are
   sensitive to changes in their membrane environment.</abstract>
