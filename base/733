	<abstract>Inasmuch as cystic fibrosis is a generalized exocrinopathy and
   affects all the mucous glands in the body, the complications of this
   disease involving the ear, nose, and throat are obviously protean.
   This presentation includes a discussion of chronic ear infections
   relative to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, a discussion of nasal
   polyps and their treatment, salivary gland involvement in cystic
   fibrosis, and the results of sialography.  The effects of
   respiratory therapy upon the upper respiratory tract and the
   problems of general anesthesia in patients who undergo surgical
   procedures are also discussed.</abstract>
