	<abstract>The sweat test, even if carried out by an experienced technician,
   sometimes lacks reproducibility owing presumably to physiological
   variations (patient&apos;s diet, temperature, and other factors at present
   unrecognized). Some patients are particularly prone to exhibit this
   variability and in them a single sweat test is almost valueless. The
   aldosterone status is believed to be responsible for a reciprocal
   relationship between sweat sodium and potassium concentrations: tests
   done on 8 patients show that a high sweat potassium is associated
   with a correspondingly lower sodium--a circumstance which must be
   borne in mind when interpreting a patient&apos;s sweat sodium. Of 30
   patients presenting with a variety of symptoms compatible with a
   diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and with sweat sodium ranging from 50 to
   75 mEq/1 (50-75 mmol/1), only 4 have proved to have cystic fibrosis
   after several years of observations; 13 have later been diagnosed as
   having asthma. The problem of the &apos;grey area&apos; of uncertainty is
   aggravated by the heterozygous state which is also associated with a
   sweat sodium in this range. Repeated sweat tests are indicated if the
   sweat sodium lies within the &apos;grey area&apos;, and the diagnostic
   importance accorded the test should diminish as the sodium value
   approaches this area. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis must remain in
   doubt unless there is strong supportive clinical evidence.</abstract>
