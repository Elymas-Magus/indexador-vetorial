	<abstract>The width of the right paratracheal stripe (RPS) has been established
   in normal adults but not in normal children. The thymus and great
   vessels are relatively larger in children than in adults and could
   obscure or widen the RPS. We found that obscuration does occur and,
   therefore, the RPS is less often measurable in children than in
   adults. Widening by the thymus and great vessels, however, does not
   occur. The width of the RPS in normal children, 0.5 to 3.0 mm, is
   slightly less than in adults. From this study of normal children and
   our subsequent experience with pediatric patients, we conclude that
   in a child an RPS 4 mm or wider is reliable evidence of disease
   affecting the trachea, mediastinum, or pleura.</abstract>
