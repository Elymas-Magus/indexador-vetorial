	<abstract>Histologic evidence of liver involvement, consisting of focal biliary
   cirrhosis and/or intrahepatic mucus, is a frequent autopsy finding in
   infants with cystic fibrosis (CF).  We wish to report an infant with
   CF in which liver biopsy showed features typical of neonatal giant
   cell hepatitis.  In our patient, none of the pathologic features
   usually described in CF were present in either of the biopsies.
   Rather, the changes were those described in neonatal hepatitis and,
   to our knowledge, have not been reported in association with CF.  It
   is likely that the giant cell hepatitis was a coincidental finding,
   unrelated to CF.  It emphasizes, however, that one cannot assume a
   uniform etiology for all instances of obstructive jaundice seen in
   infants with CF.</abstract>
