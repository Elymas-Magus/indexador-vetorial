	<abstract>The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency and
   etioloical factors of neuroaxonal dystrophy (N.D.) in brainstem and
   spinal cord of children with various non-neurological diseases.  The
   materials used in this study consisted of 266 consecutive autopsies
   from 1974-1976 and an additional 13 cases from previous years.  By
   far, the most common cause of N.D. in children was chemotherapeutic
   drugs, particularly vincristine, used for the treatment of malignant
   tumors.  Approximately 90% of these children developed N.D. and the
   changes ranged from mild to severe.  Approximately two-thirds of
   children with cystic fibrosis, congestive heart failure and chronic
   renal failure developed N.D. and the changes were mostly mild.  Only
   one-third of patients with congenital biliary atresia and
   malnutrition developed N.D. and the changes were always mild.  The
   frequency and severity of N.D. increased in patients who had
   prolonged clinical courses; no N.D. was seen in patients who died
   from acute cases such as trauma, acute infection, intoxication,
   acute renal failure or prematurity.  This type of N.D. may be
   considered as reactive to a wide variety of injurious factors such
   as drug toxicity, malnutrition, chronic hypoxia and chronic renal
   failure, either alone or in combination.  In contrast to previous
   reports of a low incidence of N.D. in children, there has been a
   sharp increase in recent years due to the advent of chemotherapy.</abstract>
