	<abstract>We demonstrate previously that fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis (CF)
   patients are significantly more resistant to the toxic effects of
   ouabain than normal human fibroblasts are. Ouabain is generally
   assumed to act primarily at the level of the cell membrane and to
   cause killing of cells by inhibiting ion transport. We have therefore
   examined the ability of normal and CF cells to survive exposure to
   ethacrynic acid, another inhibitor of ion transport, and to survive
   colchicine and aminopterin, resistance to which has been associated
   with membrane alterations in other cells. The effect of
   dexamethasone, which has a sterol nucleus similar to that of ouabain
   but is thought to have a different site of cellular action, was also
   tested. Exposure of the cells to ethacrynic acid, colchicine, or
   aminopterin did not reveal any differences in survival between normal
   and CF fibroblasts. However, CF cells survived exposure to
   dexamethasone significantly better than normal cells did. These
   results suggest that normal and CF cells do not differ in terms of a
   generalized resistance to ion transport inhibitors or to drugs that
   must pass through the membrane to be active. Instead, the results
   raise the possibility that CF cells have an enhanced resistance to
   drugs that have the sterol nucleus found in ouabain and
   dexamethasone.</abstract>
