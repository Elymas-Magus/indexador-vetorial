	<abstract>In 1972 May, Herrick, and Thompson questioned the classical
   hypothesis of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and suggested that C.F.
   children are in fact abnormally susceptible fo any respiratory
   pathogen from birth.  It is perhaps a bit premature to change the
   classical hypothesis for the bacteriology of C.F.  Since the
   predominant flora of hospital nurseries is not now Staph. aureus
   but rather gram-negative bacteria, it may be that the initial
   exposure of C.F. patients is to an organism other than Staph.
   aureus.  In addition, other organisms are becoming as resistant to
   antibodies as Ps. aeruginosa, so other organisms could perhaps be
   present in terminal sputum flora - which agrees with our data.</abstract>
