	<abstract>We have attempted to reproduce the isoelectric focusing in thin layer
   polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) method specified by Wilson et al. in our
   laboratory.  Since the resolution obtained with their procedure
   appeared to be inadequate for identifying single protein bands in the
   relevant region, we have incorporated several methodologic
   improvements into the isoelectric focusing technique.  These
   improvements have significantly enhanced the resolution and have thus
   enabled us to demonstrate a greater degree of heterogeneity of serum
   gamma-globulins than is visible in the paper of Wilson et al.
   Despite the significant increase in the number of bands resolved by
   our method, a difference among CF, heterozygote, and control sera in
   the pH 8.4 - 8.5 region could not be detected.  In addition, the
   two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis technique of Altland et al. has
   been tested in our laboratory.  We have also modified this analytic
   procedure, enabling the fractionation of several small proteins from
   a portion of the IgG fraction.  Again, despite an improvement in
   resolution which reveals more heterogeneity, no unique protein has
   been observed consistently in the CF and heterozygote area.</abstract>
