	<title>Cystic fibrosis: thyroid function and alpha fetoprotein [letter].</title>

	<abstract>Our recent studies showed normal serum thyroxine but lower serum
   total and free tri-iodothyronine and higher serum thyrotropin
   concentration in children with cystic fibrosis than in controls
   matched for age and sex.  Furthermore, administration of iodides to
   children with cystic fibrosis resulted in goiter decrease in serum
   thyroxine and increase in serum thyrotropin concentration.  Our
   studies point to multiple derangement in thyroid hormone economy in
   children with cystic fibrosis.  Peripheral deiodination of thyroxine
   to tri-iodothyronine may be defective, probably as a result of a
   state of malnutrition.  An intrinsic abnormality may also be present
   in the thyroid gland.  Iodide, which is frequently used in this
   disease, may enhance this defect, occasionally producing
   hypothyroidism.  Therefore, the thyroid, like other organs of
   endodermal origin (lung and pancreas), may be involved in cystic
   fibrosis.  Thyroid function should be examined in all children with
   cystic fibrosis, and if iodides are administered, replacement doses
   of thyroid hormones should also be given to prevent hypothyroidism.
   - A recent review of cystic fibrosis referred to the report by
   Chandra et al. that the serum level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is
   increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or heterozygotes who
   bear the CF gene.  The report of Chandra et al. had prompted us to
   assess the level of AFP in cystic fibrosis, and we wish to record
   here briefly our negative observations.  On the whole, these results
   suggest that AFP is not increased in cystic fibrosis. - We thought
   that the complications of therapy with iodides or other agents was
   beyond the scope of our review, and thus we did not discuss the very
   interesting observations of the high rate of goiter after iodide
   therapy in CF patients.  Whether this phenomenon indicates a
   subclinical thyroid defect related to CF per se or is a secondary
   effect of chronic illness in youth is still unsettled.</abstract>
