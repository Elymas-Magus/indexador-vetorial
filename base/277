	<abstract>During the past year, we have developed a new assay for cystic
   fibrosis by utilising the Ussing chamber technique and measuring the
   electrical properties of rat jejunum in the presence of the sera to
   be tested.  The potential difference (P.D.) and resistance (R.) are
   measured with a sensitive electrometer at 5-minute intervals over 60
   minutes.  We were able to detect 90% of the heterozygotes.  The
   possibility of detecting the remaining 10% is present, and can, we
   feel, be achieved by using a more concentrated specimen.</abstract>
