	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis (CF) children had a greater variability of skin prick
   test response compared with asthmatic children, when the tests were
   performed on two occasions. This suggests that there is a different
   cause for the allergy in the two groups, perhaps because the
   asthmatics have a transient period of susceptibility to sensitization
   in infancy and the CF children a persistent vulnerability. Amongst
   the asthmatic children, clinical improvement was associated with loss
   of some skin prick test reactions, and clinical deterioration with an
   increase in the number of positive reactions. Thus continuing
   allergic reactions may maintain a mucosal defect, resulting in a
   persistence of susceptibility to allergen sensitization, and control
   of the reactions may re-establish normal mucosal defence mechanisms.</abstract>
