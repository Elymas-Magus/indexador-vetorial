	<abstract>Mucociliary clearance data obtained by our group in relatively
   healthy cystic fibrosis subjects was not affected by cough.  The
   majority of subjects mentioned in the original article did not cough
   during the study and indeed were chosen because they were relatively
   healthy at the time.  It was possible to study them over fairly long
   periods without interference from cough and thus the relatively
   normal clearance times demonstrated were presumably due to
   mucociliary transport.  Reference was made to nasal mucociliary
   clearance studies in patients with cystic fibrosis and normal
   subjects which indicated that clearance was similar in both groups
   until mild inflammation of the nasal mucosa was produced.  We would
   like to point out that the work was performed in our Laboratory,
   since no reference was given in the discussion.</abstract>
