	<abstract>Concentrations of immunoglobulins were determined (using Mancini
   method and WHO standard) in 108 sera taken during long term
   treatment of 45 children with C.F. from 2 months to 16 years old.
   They were shown to depend markedly on the clinical state of the
   children particularly on the presence of pulmonary tract infectious
   processes.  These infections caused a rise in immunoglobulin
   concentration with predominance of IgM in C.F. children aged up to 3
   yrs, and with predominance of IgG in older children.  Mean titer of
   isohemagglutinins in children with C.F. was higher than in healthy
   children.  Low titers of diphtherial and stapholococcal antibodies
   were found.  In the case of anti diphtheria antibodies, this can be
   attributed to the fact that these children are not regularly
   vaccinated owing to their poor clinical condition.  As to the low
   titer of antistaphylococcal antibodies this is a well known finding
   in the course of chronic staphylococcal infections of appropriate
   bacteriological tests in our C.F. children.  Furthermore their
   lymphocytes showed an increased blastic transformation when
   stimulated with staphylococcal filtrate.  Transformation of
   PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was normal.</abstract>
