	<abstract>Evidence is presented to support the concept that much of the
   allergy in cystic fibrosis (CF) is IgE mediated.  Total IgE levels
   were higher in allergic than in nonallergic CF patients.  Levels
   were also higher in those patients who had had the greatest number
   of chest infections in the preceding 12 months.  IgE antibody levels
   to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Timothy grass pollen, and
   Aspergillus fumigatus were higher in those with positive results
   from skin tests to these allergens.  The serum IgG, IgM, and IgA
   levels of allergic and nonallergic CF patients did not differ but
   the overall mean values for IgG and iGM were higher than those
   reported for healthy British children.  The highest levels tended to
   be present in patients with the greatest number of recent major
   chest infections and the difference was significant for IgG.  16
   patients had IgA levels &gt;2 SD below the reported means for
   age-matched controls and 11 of these were nonallergic.  IgA levels
   were also higher in patients who had recently experienced major
   chest infections.  45 of the patients were tissue types for HLA A
   and B antigens but no significant clinical associations with single
   antigens were observed.  The antigen phenotype A1 + B8 was more
   common in patients with multiple allergic symptoms than in those
   with a single allergy or merely a positive result from a skin test.
   Nonsignificant increases of W19 in patients with frequent infections
   and of A2 in patients presenting with meconium ileus were also
   noted.  The data presented do not permit a choice to be made between
   the alternative concepts of allergy as a primary abnormality in CF,
   and allergy arising secondary to infection.</abstract>
