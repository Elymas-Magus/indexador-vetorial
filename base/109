	<abstract>I have observed that the skin of children with cystic fibrosis
   wrinkles excessively early when soaked in tap water.  This physical
   sign is highly reliable irrespective of the degree of nutrition of
   the patient.  It is sometimes seen in infants with marasmus.
   Normal skin wrinkles eventually to exposure to water (except that
   from the Dead Sea).  It is possible that the disorder of salt flux
   in cystic fibrosis is connected with the apparent excessive
   hypertonic reactivity of the skin.  Three minutes and a bowl of
   water might provide a cheap screening test for this condition.</abstract>
