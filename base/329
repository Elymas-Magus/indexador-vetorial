	<abstract>The importance of regular efficient postural drainage cannot be
   emphasised too strongly.  Most parents of pre-school and primary
   school children are young enough to be physically able to play a
   major role in the routine physiotherapy treatment.  The parents will
   require a great deal of support and encouragement from the
   physiotherapist, who must be ready to organise professional
   physiotherapy at crisis times in the family as well as in the event
   of an exacerbation.</abstract>
