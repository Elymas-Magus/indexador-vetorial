	<abstract>Jejunal biopsy specimens were obtained from children with cystic
   fibrosis (CF), celiac disease (CD), or congenital exocrine
   pancreatic hypoplasia (CEPH) and from control subjects.  Sections
   were examined histologically and homogenates were used for
   measurement of enterokinase and sucrase activities.  This work was
   undertaken because enterokinase is considered a brush border enzyme,
   the release of which into the intestinal lumen is influenced by
   pancreatic enzymes, and also because we have recently shown a small
   bowel mucosal dysfunction in patients with CF.  As expected, sucrase
   activity was reduce (p &lt; .05) in children with CD as compared to the
   other three groups.  On the other hand, enterokinase activity in
   children with pancreatic insufficiency (CF and CEPH) was higher (p &lt;
   .05) than that of control subjects.  The present study has shown
   that in patients with CF and CEPH, mucosal enterokinase activity was
   increased as compared to control subjects.  It seems that the
   pancreatic enzymes play a large role in the turnover of enzymes in
   the brush border membrane and that the observed increase of mucosal
   enterokinase activity is probably explained by a reduced degradation
   in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.</abstract>
