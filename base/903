	<abstract>The terminal complement components, C3 to C9, contribute to the
   host&apos;s defense against infection.  This study was performed to
   determine if defective activation of C3 to C9 by bacteria contributes
   to the pathogenesis of the recurrent pulmonary infections in cystic
   fibrosis.  When each of the bacteria was incubated in the serum of
   patients with cystic fibrosis for 30 minutes, the consumption of
   available C3 was the same as in the sera of the control patients and
   of the two patients with chronic, severe bronchiectasis.  Based on
   the results of the present study, it is unlikely that defective
   activation of C3 to C9 contributes to the pathogenesis of the
   increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections of these patients.</abstract>
