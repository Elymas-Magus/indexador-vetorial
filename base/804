	<abstract>Massive hemoptysis (volume of expectorated blood &gt; 300 ml in 24
   hours) occurred in 38 (5 per cent) of 728 patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  Twenty-two of the patients were in the midst of a
   relatively long-lasting flare-up of pulmonary infection.  There was
   no other consistent precipitating event.  All but 7 of the patients
   were admitted after the initial episode and were treated with
   parenteral antimicrobial drugs.  Postural drainage was resumed as
   rapidly as possible after cessation of acute bleeding.  Vitamin K
   was administered to all patients.  Volumes of expectorated blood
   were as large as 2,500 ml with the initial episode.  Blood pressure
   changes occurred in 4 patients.  Five patients received blood
   transfusions.  Bleeding stopped without surgical intervention in all
   patients, usually within 4 days.  The 38 patients had a total of 85
   episodes of bleeding.  No surgical treatment was undertaken at this
   center.  One patient underwent a lobectomoy at another hospital but
   continued to bleed postoperatively.  Ten patients died (mean
   survival after hemoptysis, 2.5 years; range, 3 months to 6 years).
   This survival rate is comparable to that of another group of
   patients with equally severe lung disease who had never bled
   profusely.  The other 28 patients remain alive from 7 months to 20
   years after their initial episode.  Our dat suggest that massive
   hemoptysis complicating cystic fibrosis may not be as ominous an
   event as has been believed in the past.  Because of the tendency of
   most patients to stop bleeding without aggressive surgical
   intervention, future studies of new therapeutic measures for massive
   hemoptysis must have appropriate untreated control patients who
   receive only medical management.</abstract>
