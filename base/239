	<abstract>It is most important to deal with the feelings of the child and his
   family in regard to cystic fibrosis.  Genuine recognition of feelings
   by the pediatric staff can go a long way toward reassuring family
   members that their long-standing burden and suffering are being
   validated and understood.  When a family manifests early signs of
   difficulty in coping with the emotional and physical stress imposed
   by cystic fibrosis, it is helpful to refer them to a child
   psychiatrist for consultation.  It is primarily the families at high
   risk for breakdown which most require early prevention and
   intervention.  The role of the pediatrician as the primary clinician
   is crucial.  It is he who must provide the support and understanding
   that are integral parts of the primary prevention of emotional
   decompensation in this disorder.</abstract>
