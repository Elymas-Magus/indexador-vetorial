	<abstract>The cystic fibrosis ciliary inhibitor (CFCI) has been partially
   purified from serum and plasma of cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes
   and heterozygotes, and from media of cultured fibroblasts derived
   from cystic fibrosis genotypes. Characterization and comparison of
   fractions containing the CFCI were carried out by polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis confirmed previous molecular
   weight estimations of 4,500 to 11,000 for the CFCI and provided an
   estimate of the number of proteins present in the fractions. Low
   molecular weight proteins from serum and media were combined with IgG
   preparations. No specific binding to IgG by the media fraction
   containing the CFCI could be demonstrated by the techniques employed.
   There was decreased binding of the low molecular weight serum
   fraction containing CFCI to native IgG molecules from cystic fibrosis
   patients as compared to IgG from normal individuals. However, IgG
   from CF individuals demonstrated increased binding of the cfci-
   containing low molecular weight serum fraction after gel filtration
   in the presence of guanidinium chloride. This suggests: 1) that very
   low concentrations of CFCI are present in media fractions; and 2)
   that native CF IgG cannot bind the low molecular weight CFCI
   fractions to the same degree as native IgG from normals or CF IgG
   that has been dissociated from non-covalently bound components.</abstract>
