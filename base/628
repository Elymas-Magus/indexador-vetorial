	<abstract>The camp on Lake Couchiching for children with CF was started in
   1973.  Initially, certain changes were necessary to make the camp
   suitable for CF campers.  Most of the activities normally available
   to campers at Camp Couchiching are continued as usual for our CF
   campers during the month of August.  Staff members spend a great
   deal of time teaching the campers about the need for pancreatic
   enzymes.  Each cystic child requires two or three physiotherapy
   treatments every day after the inhalation of prescribed
   bronchodilators and antibiotics.</abstract>
