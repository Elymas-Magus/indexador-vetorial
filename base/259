	<abstract>The urinary excretion of adenosine 3&apos;,5&apos;-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)
   and guanosine 3&apos;,5&apos;-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was examined in 98
   normal children and 46 children with cystic fibrosis between the ages
   of 9 months and 18 yr. Diurnal variations in cyclic AMP and cyclic
   GMP excretion were observed in subjects from either group, and peak
   levels of cyclic nucleotide excretion were generally observed during
   the period of 0700 to 2100 h. Excretion rates (mumol/day) of cyclic
   AMP and cyclic GMP increased significantly with age. When cyclic AMP
   and cyclic GMP excretion rates were normalized for urinary creatine,
   or body weight, the values declined significantly with age in both
   groups of patients. Cyclic GMP excretion normalized for body surface
   area also decreased with age, while the value for cyclic AMP (2.86
   plus or minus 0.08 mumol/day/m2, mean plus or minus SE) was constant
   with age in both normals and cystic fibrosis children. With some
   comparisons of age groups there were significant differences in
   cyclic nucleotide excretion between normal subjects and children with
   cystic fibrosis. The differences noted were dependent upon the
   methods used to normalize excretion rates (urinary creatine, body
   weight, surface area, and the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP
   excreted). In general patients with cystic fibrosis excreted greater
   amounts of cyclic GMP than did normals. The most striking comparison
   was the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted which was 9.09
   plus or minus 0.50 in all normal children and 4.41 plus or minus 0.32
   in children with cystic fibrosis (P smaller than 0.001).</abstract>
