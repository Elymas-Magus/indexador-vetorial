	<abstract>Despite the critical role played by a clinical pharmacologist, there
   are only three in Canada who specialize in paediatrics.  The role of
   paediatric clinical pharmacologists in the promotion of safer and
   more effective drug use, in research, in teaching, and in service are
   discussed, as well as contributions from clinical pharmacology.</abstract>
