	<abstract>Chest physiotherapy still remains one of the most important aspects
   in the treatment of chest complications of cystic fibrosis. A
   mechanical device that allows the patient with cystic fibrosis to do
   his own chest physiotherapy will be of great benefit if it is as
   effective as manual percussion. 14 patients with cystic fibrosis
   using mechanical and manual percussion physiotherapy were studied by
   measuring sputum volumes, and FEV and FVC. Results with mechanical
   percussor were as good as with the manual percussor and, therefore,
   it would be reasonable for the older patient to use the former on his
   own.</abstract>
