	<abstract>This paper describes investigations on the absorption of
   3-methoxyphenyl-L-alanine (anisylalanine) in normal subjects,
   children with cystic fibrosis and in one child with Hartnup disease.
   Anisylalanine was slowly metabolised mainly to acetyl anisylalanine,
   and p-methoxyphenyl-pyruvic acid and lactic acids which were
   excreted.  In normal adult subjects anisylalanine (25 mg/kg body
   weight) was rapidly absorbed, maximum plasma concentrations being
   obtained 0.5-1.0 hour after ingestion.  Thereafter the plasma
   concentration declined exponentially.  In the group of eight
   children with cystic fibrosis, the maximum plasma concentration
   was lower than observed in the control group, and was delayed.  A
   very poor response was observed in an infant with Hartnup disorder.</abstract>
