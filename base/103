	<abstract>The letter from Professor Elliott appears to be the first record of
   skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis and may be an observation as
   important as that of di Sant&apos; Agnese when he noted the high salt
   concentration of the sweat.  It seems that parents are well aware
   of this response, and repeating Professor Elliott&apos;s observation by
   soaking the hands of six infants with cystic fibrosis in hot water
   showed that very marked wrinkling was present by five minutes and
   often by two minutes.  This did not occur in control children of
   similar nutritional state except in a case of twins - one with
   cystic fibrosis, one without - where the unaffected child&apos;s fingers
   began to wrinkle slightly by five minutes.  The wrinkling does not
   appear to be associated with wasting due to malnutrition since it
   occurs equally in plump and in thin infants with cystic fibrosis,
   nor is it present in children with severe wasting and respiratory
   disease not due to cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
