	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis is a common and serious disease, and presents a
   challenge in management to the paediatrician, nurse, dietitian,
   physiotherapist, and all other members of the caring team.  The
   outstanding research challenge is to discover the basic defect, and
   if this is not treatable to find a method of identifying carriers
   and affected infants in utero.  In this task, the work of the Cystic
   Fibrosis Research Trust, both in raising money for research and for
   supporting and advising patients, is much appreciated.</abstract>
