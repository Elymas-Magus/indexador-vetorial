	<abstract>We were interested in the case reported by Mukherji et al., which
   suggested that cystic fibrosis might be an acid
   mucopolysaccharidosis.  We have seen a similar child.  Aged 5 years
   he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia.  In spite of conventional
   treatment with cloxacillin and colistin he collapsed and died 48
   hours after admission.  The heart was not enlarged, but the
   myocardium showed a grossly abnormal appearance with variations in
   thickness and extensive areas of firm pale tissue.  Histology of the
   heart muscle showed very dramatic changes with severe replacement
   fibrosis distributed patchily through the myocardium.  This similar
   mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides was shown in both the
   pancreas and the salivary glands.  There have now been a number of
   reports of myocardial fibrosis complicating cystic fibrosis.  The
   case reported by Mukherji et al. and this case are the first in which
   mucopolysaccharide deposits have been found in the myocardium.  The
   mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides in our case does not
   support the hypothesis that cystic fibrosis is simply a genetic acid
   mucopolysaccharidosis.</abstract>
