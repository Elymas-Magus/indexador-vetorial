	<abstract>The effect of plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for
   the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene on the active uptake of 3-0-14C-methyl-
   D-glucose (3-0-14C-MDG) by rat jejunal epithelium was studied.
   Furthermore, the role of the polyamine, spermidine, and its products
   of metabolic degradation on glucose transport were investigated, and
   a relationship to the pathogenesis of membrane dysfunction in cystic
   fibrosis was postulated. Glucose transport in everted rat jejunal
   rings was used in the study. Results were expressed as 3-0-14C-MDG
   concentration ratio between the intracellular (ICF) and the
   extracellular fluid spaces (ECF) of the jejunal rings at the end of a
   60 min incubation period. The mean ratio obtained from incubations of
   the rat jejunal rings in medium consisting of Krebs-Ringer-
   bicarbonate buffer and the labeled sugar was considered as 100%
   uptake. When plasma or serum, with or without spermidine, was mixed
   with the medium in a volume ratio of 1:3, a decrease in the active
   uptake of 3-0-14C-MDG was observed, expressed as percent inhibition.
   Percent inhibition of 3-0-14C-MDG uptake obtained when the rat
   jejunal rings were incubated in normal plasma was compared to that
   obtained with plasma from cystic fibrosis genotypes. It was found
   that: 1) plasma from 25 homozygous children had greater inhibitory
   effect on glucose uptake than plasma from 26 normal children; 2)
   plasma from 9 heterozygous women had greater inhibitory effect than
   that from 6 normal women; 3) the inhibitory effect of plasma from 3
   homozygous children was not influenced by dialysis; 4) the inhibitory
   effects of paired plasma and serum samples from 9 homozygotes were
   comparable; 5) spermidine added to the incubating electrolyte
   solution did not affect glucose transport; 6) the addition of
   spermidine to reaction mixtures containing normal plasma potentiated
   the inhibitory effect; and 7) mixing and incubation of fresh bovine
   serum with reaction mixtures containing plasma from homozygotes
   decreased the inhibitory effect. The predominant inhibitory effect of
   plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for the CF gene
   appears to be related to a nondialyzeable molecule(s). It does not
   seem to reflect the presence of high plasma glucose levels in cystic
   fibrosis nor to be the result of competitive inhibition between
   sugars. It does not seem to be the result of sodium or other
   electrolyte differences. A similar inhibitory effect is acquired by
   normal plasma after the addition of spermidine. On the other hand,
   plasma from CF homozygotes loses its inhibitory effect after
   incubation with fresh bovine serum. These findings may indicate that
   products of metabolic degradation of spermidine are responsible for
   the inhibitory effect of glucose transport and suggest the
   possibility of a role in abnormal polyamine metabolism in the
   pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
