	<abstract>The problem of proper diet to children and infants with cystic
   fibrosis is continuously discussed.  This paper deals with the diet
   for CF infants younger than one year.  The basic view is that the
   diet should be as close to the &apos;normal baby&apos; diet as possible, partly
   to ensure normal growth and development, and partly to avoid extra
   work for the families with CF infants.  Infants suffering from CF
   were given lactose-free diet until they reached the age of one year.
   The weight increased more rapidly than in CF patients given the
   traditional CF diet with low fat and high protein.  Furthermore, it
   was not necessary to give increased amounts of calories to the
   infants given lactose-free diet, nor did they receive additional
   fat-soluble vitamins.</abstract>
