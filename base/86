	<abstract>A strain of Staphylococcus aureus (no. FAR4) has been isolated from
   a patient at frequent intervals over 18 months.  This strain has
   previously been shown to lose resistance to several antibodies
   (Lacey et al., 1973); during the last 6 months further changes have
   occurred in it in vivo.  Lincomycin resistance appeared after the
   patient had been treated with clindamycin.  This was due to mutation
   to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin at a
   locus adjacent to that determining &quot;inducible&quot; resistance to
   erythromycin.  Both loci are probably carried by an extrachromosomal
   element.  Three types of variation in the PF plasmid were observed.
   Alteration in production of penicillinase from macroconstitutive to
   microconstitutive, was not associated with any detectable change in
   plasmid size.  This change gave the cell an advantage in vitro,
   because it was associated with a faster growth rate and probably
   also in vivo, because the microconstitutive variants were isolated
   in increasing numbers after flucloxacillin therapy had ceased.
   Complete loss of determinants for penicillinase production and for
   resistance to cadmium ions from the PF plasmid was associated with a
   decrease in plasmid size of about 4 x 10 6 daltons.  This change was
   also associated with increased growth rate in vitro.  Loss of
   resistance to fusidic acid from the PF plasmid was associated with a
   decrease in plasmid size of about 1 x 10 6 daltons.</abstract>
