	<abstract>6 patients with proven cystic fibrosis and a wide variety of
   Schwachman clinical scores were studied and the controls were 10
   healthy children undergoing minor elective surgical procedures.  The
   results show that for children with cystic fibrosis there are not
   only decreased proportions of essential fatty acids but that 20:3
   omega-9 is found in all cases.  Our results suggest that there is no
   intrinsic defect of the desaturating system in cystic fibrosis and
   that the pattern of essential-fatty-acid deficiency is entirely
   similar to that found in dietary deficiency of essential fatty
   acids.  A further significant finding is the occurance if 20:3
   omega-9 in apparently healthy children, particularly the very young.
   This is probably diet-related and emphasises the young child&apos;s very
   large requirement for essential fatty acids for membrane synthesis.
   The need for adequate polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood
   cannot be overstated, whether they be for normal membrane synthesis
   or lowering of serum-lipids, giving possible protection against
   cardiovascular disease.</abstract>
