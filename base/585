	<abstract>The glucagon and insulin responses to intravenous arginine were
   studied in 17 children with cystic fibrosis and in 9 control
   children. It was found that the overall secretion of insulin was
   diminished; however, four of the CF children did have a normal
   output. The glucagon responses did not parallel those of insulin. The
   glucagon output varied in the CF children--seven had normal, four
   excessively high and six low output. Three of the four children with
   extremely high output had more severe disease and were below the
   third centile on the weight chart. These four had a fasting
   hypoglycaemia and also a very low glucose and insulin response. We
   have confirmed diminished insulin secretion in cystic fibrosis, but
   diminished glucagon secretion was only noted when some insulin
   secretion was preserved. The high levels of glucagon seen in the most
   insulin deficient subjects may be derived from extrapancreatic
   sources, or may be associated with &apos;stress&apos; reaction in these
   patients who also had most severe pulmonary involvement. The data
   would be consistent with diminished glucagon and insulin secretion
   from the pancreas but as the disease progresses an excessive
   secretion of extra pancreatic glucagon results.</abstract>
