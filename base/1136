	<abstract>Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated significant
   differences in the extent of protease reactivity with MUGB
   (4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate, a sensitive active site
   titrant of many serine proteases) when plasma and cultivated skin
   fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate
   heterozygotes, and controls were compared.  Because of these
   observations, and the potential value of amniotic fluid for the
   prenatal detection of cystic fibrosis, these studies were extended to
   human amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis done for the
   intrauterine detection of genetic and other fetal abnormalities.  An
   amniotic-fluid sample obtained from a woman who was subsequently
   delivered of a baby with CF showed a much reduced level of MUGB
   reactivity similar to the relative deficiency observed in plasma and
   cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients with CF.  These
   observations suggest that amniotic-fluid protease activity may be a
   useful marker for the prenatal detection of CF.</abstract>
