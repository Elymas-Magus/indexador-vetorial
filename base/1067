	<abstract>In 28 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 5--24 years the values of
   maximum expiratory flow rates (Vmax) at lower volume levels were
   assessed, as well as the &quot;specific&quot; conductance of the respiratory
   pathways (Gaw/TGV), the vital capacity (VC), total lung capacity
   (TLC), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC),
   RV/TLC and FRC/TLC ratios and the one-second forced expiration of the
   vital capacity (FEV1) to evaluate obstruction of the respiratory
   pathways. Most markedly and most frequently abnormal were the values
   of Vmax, RV and of the RV/TLC ratio. These findings revealed that in
   almost all patients with CF there was already during the initial
   examination an obstruction of the peripheral respiratory pathways and
   hyperinflation of the lungs. During repeated measurement of the above
   values of lung function in 15 patients with cystic fibrosis during a
   period of 1--5 years when the patients increased in height by 10 cm
   on average, the above values did not deteriorate on average. There
   was, however, an individual variability of the investigated values
   during this period. The comprehensive treatment provided in our
   country prevented in patients with CF a deterioration of obstruction
   of the respiratory pathways during the period of investigation.</abstract>
