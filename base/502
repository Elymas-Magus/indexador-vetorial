	<abstract>If we are to fully understand the factors which control mucociliary
   clearance throughout the human lung and the interrelationships
   between clearance and disease, it will be necessary to measure
   mucociliary clearance rates in airways at all levels within the lung.
   During the past few years, technical means have been sought whereby
   the rates of mucus clearance within individual airways can be
   measured.  In this laboratory, we have developed a relatively
   noninvasive technique for measuring mucociliary tracheal transport
   rates.  We measured MTTRs in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis.  The
   MTTRs did not correlate well with the degree of pulmonary disease in
   these patients.  The measurements of MTTR would suggest that a
   deranged mucociliary clearance mechanism is not a necessary condition
   for patients with CF.  We have also been interested in evaluating the
   effectiveness of the therapy used in the treatment of CF.</abstract>
