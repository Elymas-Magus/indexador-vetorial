	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis is the most common form of chronic pulmonary disease
   in the pediatric age group.  As these children survive longer with
   improved therapy, the incidence of pneumothorax has increased.  In
   our patients who were more than 10 years of age, the incidence of
   pneumothorax was 12.5 percent.  We have reviewed the records of 22
   patients who have had 44 episodes of pneumothorax complicating
   cystic fibrosis.  In addition, our experience includes one child
   with histiocytosis in whom pneumothorax was a serious complication.
   One other pneumothorax occurred in a teen-age girl with apical
   bullous disease.  A child who presents with even a minimal
   pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis is at considerable risk of
   developing an increasing lung collapse.  Even if the pneumothorax
   resolves, there is a high risk of recurrence.  In children treated
   with only a chest tube there was a 50 percent recurrence.
   Consequently, we recommend a chest tube for any episode of
   pneumothorax in a child with cystic fibrosis, with installation of a
   sclerosing agent when the lung expands.  Three of our patients so
   treated had no recurrence.  Children who have a persistent air leak
   are confined to bed, retain secretions, and pursue a rapid downhill
   course.  A more aggressive approach to these children, consisting of
   thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, pteural symphysis, and
   pulmonary lavage is feasible and the mortality rate is low.  A
   pneumothorax in a child with no evidence of cystic fibrosis is a
   rare event.  A persistent air leak is an indication for thoracotomy,
   suture of the air leak, and lung biopsy.  Histiocytosis X is one
   rare cause for this complication in children.</abstract>
