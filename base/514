	<abstract>The incidence of and mortality from cystic fibrosis in New Zealand
   for the years 1965-1971 have been reviewed. Data were obtained from
   hospital admission and death records. All of the 171 cases were of
   European parentage except for one part-Maori child. The minimum
   incidence of cystic fibrosis in the European population (one in 3185
   live births) is comparable with that in other populations of similar
   background but somewhat lower than that derived by Becroft (1968).
   The data show that, during the period of the survey, approximately 30
   percent of cystic fibrosis suffereres died at less than 12 months of
   age.</abstract>
