	<abstract>Despite some critical debate lately about the usefulness of
   physiotherapy in certain chest conditions, the fact remains that many
   patients voluntarily undertake regular postural bronchial drainage to
   help their sputum.  A substantial number also find rapid chest
   percussion over affected lung segments useful in loosening the
   sputum.  Chest percussion by a mechanical device controlled by the
   patient himself seems worthy to trial.  Maxwell and Redmond have
   compared a commercial device with manual percussion during postural
   bronchial drainage.  The two techniques resulted in expectoration of
   similar quantities of sputum, although all but one patient felt
   subjectively that the machine delivered better-quality percussion.
   Before parents and others are advised to buy percussing machines, we
   need a formal study of postural drainage with and without chest
   percussion.</abstract>
