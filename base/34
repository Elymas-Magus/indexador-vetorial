	<abstract>The coexistence of cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease has recently
   been reported, and it has been suggested that cystic fibrosis may
   predispose to the later development of coeliac disease.  The
   diagnosis of coeliac disease is largely dependent upon the
   demonstration of histological changes in the small intestine, but
   jejunal biopsy may be distressing to a small child.  It is
   suggested that food protein antibody studies may be of value in the
   investigation of children with cystic fibrosis in whom gluten
   sensitivity is suspected.  In the following case the decision to
   perform a jejunal biopsy was made when these studies were positive.
   Food protein antibody to cereal antigens, wheat, oatmeal, and
   gluten, and to ruminant antigens, cow&apos;s milk, and calf serum were
   persistently detected in the patient&apos;s blood.  Jejunal biopsy
   showed partial villous atrophy with shortening, broadening, and
   branching of the villi.  There was a satisfactory clinical
   improvement after gluten restriction.</abstract>
