	<abstract>The autopsies of 82 patients with cystic fibrosis were reviewed with
   respect to pathologic changes in the lungs and their respective
   prevalence among different age groups. Although bronchitis,
   mucopurulent plugging, and bronchopneumonia were almost universally
   present among children of all ages, epithelial metaplasia and
   bronchiectasis were rarer among infants and progressively more
   prevalent in older age groups. Emphysema was absent in patients under
   two years of age and affected 11 per cent of the patients two to six
   years of age and 40 per cent of the patients older than six years,
   but was never of a severe degree by the point count method. Pulmonary
   hemorrhage, although uncommon, was usually associated with prominent
   arterial vessels in walls of bronchiectatic airways. Quantitative
   assessment of bronchial glands revealed Reid indices significantly
   higher in patients with cystic fibrosis when compared to noncystic
   fibrosis patients, but there was no increase in these indices with
   the age of the patients. Glandular hypertrophy, predominance of
   mucous acini within glands, and goblet cell hyperplasia of the
   bronchial mucosa all suggest an explanation for the copious mucous
   secretion of patients with cystic fibrosis. However, it was not
   possible to ascertain whether these findings reflect a general
   exocrine defect of such patients or whether they were merely a
   response to chronic airway infection, even though the latter is a
   more plausible assumption.</abstract>
