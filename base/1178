	<abstract>Meconium specimens from more than 200 normal and premature and from 5
   cystic fibrosis newborns were analyzed for their level of several
   glycosidases.  Considerable scatter of activities were found in all
   three groups studied and no evidence for any relation of such scatter
   with the blood group-specific A, B, AB, H substances was found.
   Alpha-glucosidase, an acid glycosidase found elevated in CF serum and
   fibroblasts, was elevated in all CF meconium extracts including that
   which had a very low albumin content.</abstract>
