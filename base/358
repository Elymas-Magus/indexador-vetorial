	<abstract>We investigated the airway&apos;s response to exercise in cystic fibrosis
   (CF).  Due to the reported high incidence of allergy in CF we tried
   to demonstrate the well documented post-exercise bronchospasm of
   asthma in patients with CF.  Subjects ran on a treadmill for 6
   minutes at a speed of 3 miles per hour and a gradient of 15 degrees.
   For the 12 controls studied, the mean % rise in peak expiratory flow
   rate (PEFR) during exercise was 4.7% and the mean % fall in PEFR
   during recovery was 0.7%.  For the eight atopic asthmatics studied
   the mean % rise in PEFR was 12.2% and the mean % fall in PEFR was
   33.7%.  For the 29 patients with CF, the mean % rise in PEFR was
   20.3% and the mean % fall in PEFR was 3.1%.  Patients with CF showed
   no statistically significant post-exercise constriction compared
   with controls, while asthmatic patients showed a post-exercise %
   fall in PEFR significantly greater than seen in controls (p &lt; 0.001)
   or in CF patients (p &lt; 0.001).  No patient with CF showed
   post-exercise bronchospasm, nor was there any difference between
   patients with CF who had positive skin tests to common allergens and
   those who did not in their pattern of bronchial liability.  It is
   suggested that the general desensitization therapy should not be
   instituted in patients with CF merely on the basis of positive skin
   tests, without more stringent criteria such as characteristic
   seasonal variation in respiratory symptomatology, family history of
   atopy and positive bronchial inhalation provocation tests.</abstract>
