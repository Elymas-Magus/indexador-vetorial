	<abstract>Many attempts have been made to establish a suitable screening test
   for cystic fibrosis for newborns.  Recently, a new method has been
   described by Crossley and her associates.  It is based on measuring
   pancreatic trypsin in a sample of faeces collected on to filter paper
   on the 4th or 5th day of life.  The false-negative rate of the new
   test has not yet been determined, but older children with CF and
   pancreatic achylia all gave abnormal results when tested.  The
   disadvantage of the test, as with the meconium albumin test, is that
   about 10% of children with CF are said not to have pancreatic
   achylia.  Whilst the method needs more extensive evaluation, it
   appears technically more satisfactory than others so far described.</abstract>
