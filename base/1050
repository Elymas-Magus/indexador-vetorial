	<abstract>1. The proportions of both saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids
   were measured in the erythrocytes in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients
   along with two membrane bound enzymes ATPase and
   acetylcholinesterase. Linoleic acid was found to be significantly
   decreased and arachidonic acid increased in CF patients. The
   proportion of saturated fatty acids were not significantly different
   from the controls. Only adenosinetriphosphatase activity was found to
   be reduced and not acetylcholinesterase in CF patients.</abstract>
