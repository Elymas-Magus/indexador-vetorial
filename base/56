	<abstract>In order to differentiate asthma from other disorders resembling it,
   one should attempt to define clearly what we mean by asthma and
   wheezing.  A most simplistic statement would define asthma as a
   recurring form of dyspnea marked by wheezing breath sounds.  The
   incompleteness of this definition is apparent: asthma is really a
   symptom complex of labored wheezing breathing, characterized by
   hyperreactivity of the bronchi to various stimuli, resulting in
   generalized narrowing of the airways, variable in scope, and often
   reversible by sympathomimetics, theophylline derivatives, and
   corticosteroids.  A variety of conditions must be considered when
   studying the wheezing child.  These include asthmatic bronchitis,
   acute bronchitis, spasmodic croup, allergic cough, habit cough,
   foreign body, cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis), right middle lobe
   syndrome, and upper and lower respiratory tract conditions simulating
   asthma.</abstract>
