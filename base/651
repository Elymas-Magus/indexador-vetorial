	<abstract>A number of voluntary organizations exist for the support of
   patients and their relatives suffering from specific medical
   conditions.  It is usually assumed that membership will provide
   positive emotional and social support but membership may provide
   dysfunctional responses.  A small-scale study of parents of
   fibrocystic children provides some evidence of dysfunctional aspects
   of membership of one specific organization.  Further research into
   the effects of formal and informal reference group activity and the
   types of support most acceptable to patients and their families is
   suggested.</abstract>
