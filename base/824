	<abstract>Controversy still surrounds the most appropriate method of management
   of children with cystic fibrosis.  The reason for much of the
   uncertainty about management of cystic fibrosis is that many
   therapeutic approaches have been proposed without properly conducted
   controlled trials.  With the current approaches to therapy, at least
   80% of children with cystic fibrosis can expect to reach adult life,
   most with minimal or no lung damage.  However, this dramatic
   improvement in survival does not indicate that cystic fibrosis is now
   an easy condition to manage and that it no longer requires
   specialised care.</abstract>
