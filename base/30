	<abstract>Patients with cystic fibrosis have tocopherol deficiency presumably
   as a result of steatorrhoea.  Evidence for possible muscular
   involvement in cystic fibrosis patients is clinical (muscular
   weakness and wasting in many patients), biochemical (creatinuria on
   a creatine-poor diet, with reversal of this finding after ingestion
   of tocopherol esters, accompanied by a decrease in creatine in
   plasma and an increase in creatine in muscle), and pathological
   (focal lesions in skeletal muscle resembling nutritional muscular
   dystrophy, and ceroid pigment in smooth muscle).  Muscle strength
   was measured with a bulb ergograph in 45 patients with cystic
   fibrosis attending the clinics at the Babies&apos; Hospital, Columbia
   Presbyterian Medical Center, New York.  In a double-blind study, in
   which half the cases received tocopherol orally, and the remainder
   placebo, no significant increase in muscle strength was found in
   those patients receiving tocopherol over a period of 6 months as
   compared to the placebo group.  Blood tocopherol levels in the
   treated group returned to normal.</abstract>
