	<abstract>Since the report of an edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex
   in infants with cystic fibrosis, several articles have been
   published.  We have also participated in the care of identical male
   twins with this interesting symptom complex.  These twins offer two
   more examples of the edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex
   of infant cystic fibrosis.  In the presence of transsupplementation
   and the absence of hemolysis, the normal serum iron and increased
   peripheral and marrow iron values suggest that the anemia results
   from a defect at the level of hemoglobin synthesis, and that iron
   transport remains sufficient in the face of protein depletion.
   Possibly, a relative iron deficiency occurs after increased
   nutritional intake due to increased utilization.  Lee suggested
   that the hypoproteinemia is due to loss of protein in stools, but
   these twins suggest that the problem lies not with losses through
   urine or stool, but rather with failure in protein synthesis.  The
   possibility of hypoproteinemia secondary to liver dysfunction is
   attractive.  Although all liver function tests and biopsy findings
   were normal, this is often the case in patients with cystic
   fibrosis.  The anemia is associated with increased serum and marrow
   iron values, and is most likely due to a decrease in hemoglobin
   synthesis.  Routine cystic fibrosis therapy appears to be
   sufficient for clinical recovery for all components of the symptom
   complex.</abstract>
