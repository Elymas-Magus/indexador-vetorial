	<abstract>Although the mechanism proposed by Dr Katznelson for the increased
   intracranial pressure observed in three infants with cystic fibrosis
   cannot be discounted, another explanation is possible.  It has been
   reported previously that a deficiency of vitamin A may predispose to
   development of increased intracranial pressure and bulging
   fontanelles in cystic fibrosis.  Finally, it is somewhat difficult to
   understand how such marked airway obstruction which produced
   increased intracranial pressure could occur with preservation of
   arterial blood gases. - Vitamin A and carotene blood levels were not
   determined in our cases and therefore obviously this possibility
   cannot be excluded, at least in two of the cases.  Dr Taussig&apos;s
   suggestion that the improvement in the intracranial pressure in our
   cases was really the result of the &quot;unknowing&quot; associated
   administration of vitamin A and not to the improvements in the
   pulmonary status, as I proposed, fails to note the clinical
   observation that there had been a &quot;rise and fall&quot; in the bulge of the
   fontanel concomitantly with the increase and decrease of respiratory
   obstruction signs.  As to the question of the severity of airway
   obstruction, the clinical reversible picture of severe tachypnea with
   poor air entry, clear lung fields on X-ray with overdistended lungs
   and small heart appear most suggestive of airway obstruction in C.F.</abstract>
