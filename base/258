	<abstract>This paper describes the Data Registry System of the Cystic Fibrosis
   Foundation.  Through this system an annual up-dated and corrected
   data base has been prepared for cystic fibrosis patients seen at
   U.S.A. Centers from 1966 through 1972.  From the data base, a large
   number of life table studies are calculated.  A study is specified
   by its data base, the observation period, analysis age (age year or
   year since diagnosis), the Centers included, and the condition of
   patients at birth, and possible additional factors such as sex, age
   at diagnosis, or race.  The annual rates of mortality are measured
   by a force of mortality technique.  Two techniques have been used to
   appraise the mortality of particular groups, graphing the cumulative
   survival function for the group together with the cumulative
   survival function for a comparative group, and calculation of
   mortality ratios of actual to expected deaths (by an applicable
   standard mortality table).  This latter approach lends itself
   readily to tests of significance.  For the purpose of calculating
   mortality ratios, two standard tables have been prepared on the
   basis of the 1972 Data Base and the 1966-1972 observations.  The
   first of these standard tables is for use with age year studies, and
   the second is for years since diagnosis studies.  The paper comments
   on the number of mortality studies by calendar year, by sex, by
   condition at birth, by age at diagnosis, and of survival from
   diagnosis of patients diagnosed in 1966-1972.  The calendar year
   studies indicate an improvement trend in the survival experience
   from 1966 to 1972 but a change may be occurring.  The study by sex
   exhibits a higher female mortality.  The 7% of patients who have
   meconium ileus at birth show a significantly higher first-year
   mortality, and a somewhat lower survival rate thereafter even if the
   first year of life experience is excluded.  Mortality data for
   groups specified by age at diagnosis are given.  For patients
   diagnosed during 1966-1972, there is some indication of better
   survival than for patients diagnosed prior to 1966.  The
   continuation of these mortality studies on an annual basis should
   further our understanding of survival patterns for cystic fibrosis
   patients.</abstract>
