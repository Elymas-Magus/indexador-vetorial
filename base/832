	<abstract>The fact that a serum factor in cystic fibrosis patients inhibits
   ciliary movement of cells of isolated tracheae, and the observation
   that ciliary movement is associated with pinocytotic activity led
   Ohno et al. to suggest that this defect is responsible for aplasia or
   hypoplasia of the wolffian duct structures in males with cystic
   fibrosis.  While Ohno&apos;s hypothesis lacks definitive proof, the
   hypoplasia or aplasia of the vas in males with cystic fibrosis is
   extremely common, producing sterility in affected males.</abstract>
