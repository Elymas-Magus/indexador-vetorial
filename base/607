	<abstract>As patients with cystic fibrosis survive longer, the number of
   adults with this chronic obstructive lung disease is increasing
   rapidly.  Chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis are similar in a
   number of respects.  The treatment of cystic fibrosis and chronic
   bronchitis has some similarities.  But chronic bronchitis and cystic
   fibrosis also differ in many respects.  The pathogenesis of chronic
   bronchitis is more clearly related to exogonous factors such as
   smoking and air pollution than is cystic fibrosis, which is
   genetically determined.  Clinical differences also exist.  Major
   differences in treatment between cystic fibrosis and chronic
   bronchitis are currently in vogue.  Because of the special problems
   of adulthood, it is appropriate that many adult patients with cystic
   fibrosis be cared for by internists who have previously focused
   their attention on chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  Increased
   communication between internists and pediatricians on the issue of
   cystic fibrosis is badly needed today.</abstract>
