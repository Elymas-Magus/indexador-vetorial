	<abstract>A retrospective study of clinical and radiological lung symptoms and
   intensity of treatment of 98 patients with cystic fibrosis was
   conducted.  The results were correlated to class of skin fibroblast
   metachromasia.  Fourteen patients belonged to class I (vesicular
   metachromasia), 52 to class II (generalized metachromasia), and 32 to
   class III (no metachromasia).  All patients above 16 years of age
   (six patients) were class II.  Simple scoring systems for clinical
   lung symptoms and for treatment of lung disease were developed.  When
   compared at the same ages, class I and III patients were more
   severely affected (judged by the clinical lung symptoms) than class
   II patients, and they had been more intensively treated.  Comparing
   class I + II patients (metachromatic fibroblasts) with class III
   patients (ametachromatic fibroblasts), it was found that class III
   patients were more severely affected and had been more intensively
   treated than class I + II patients.  As regards chest radiographs
   (judged by Norman&apos;s system) a similar pattern was seen, but no
   statistically significant differences were found.  In 68 patients (9
   of class I, 35 of class II, and 24 of class III) the serum protein
   electrophoretic fractions were studied.  It was found that class III
   patients had more severe alterations than class II patients, and more
   than class I + II patients.  The proportion of female patients in
   class III was greater than in the other two classes, but this could
   not explain the differences.  Because of the small number of patients
   in class I, the differences between class I and class II patients are
   more doubtful than the differences between class III and class II
   patients, or between class III and class I + II patients.</abstract>
