	<abstract>Immunochemical and functional properties of control and Cystic
   Fibrosis (CF) alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2M) are compared. Crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis and Ouchterlony double diffusion revealed no
   qualitative differences between the two alpha 2-M preparations.
   Trypsin-esterase activity assayed with BAPNA as a substrate, in the
   presence of an excess STI, gave similar ratios between total and
   active alpha 2M. These alpha 2M-trypsin complexes were equally stable
   under various experimental conditions and maintained a constant STI
   non-inhibited esterase activity. Normal and CF-alpha 2M-trypsin
   complexes were taken up by normal human fibroblasts to a similar
   extent during a four hour period. The only significant difference was
   observed when the uptake of alpha 2M from untreated sera was
   examined. The uptake of alpha 2M from CF sera was always lower than
   from pooled control sera despite large variation. Mixing of control
   and CF serum did not affect the normal uptake and other serum
   components were taken up to the normal extent. Intracellular
   degradation of CF alpha 2M had a half life of 2.0 to 2.8 hours, which
   compares well to the normal half life of 2.2 hours. More work needs
   to be done on the nature of the interaction between alpha 2M and
   proteases before a reasonable explanation for the molecular nature of
   the abnormal behavior can be sought.</abstract>
