	<abstract>One of the most consistent characteristics of cystic fibrosis is the
   abnormal handling of electrolytes by exocrine glands. The present
   study has examined the possibility that diminished respiratory energy
   formation is a primary biochemical error responsible for this
   abnormality. Using oxygen consumption of intact larval brine shrimp,
   quantitative differences have been observed from reaction of mixed
   mouth saliva between CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes. In
   addition, information demonstrating a correlation between a
   biochemical abnormality and disease severity was observed. The
   differences observed in inhibition by saliva from both CF homozygotes
   and obligate heterozygotes may occur as the result of 1) interference
   with electron transfer from organic fuel molecules to molecular
   oxygen or 2) interference with the mechanism responsible for
   generating the biochemical reducing power necessary for multiple
   biosynthetic reactions.</abstract>
