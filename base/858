	<abstract>The cystic fibrosis (CF) culture phenotype of dermal fibroblasts
   (metachromasia, metabolic cooperation) of a group of 131 Danish CF
   patients and their families were studied to determine the
   distribution of the two CF culture classes and their prognostic
   significance. Of these, 62.6% (82) were Class I, 31.3% (41) Class II
   and 61.1% (8) were proposed to be genetic compounds. The occurrence
   of Class II was twice that found in a group of patients from New York
   (13%) and Minnesota (18%). The prognosis for Class II CF patients was
   considered to be poorer as: (1) The initial diagnosis was made
   earlier in Class II than in Class I or the compounds (63% of Class II
   were diagnosed in the first year of life, as compared to 35% in Class
   I and 13% of the compounds). (2) Only 5% of the Class II patients
   survived over the age of 15 years, both being deceased at the end of
   the study in 1976, whereas 24% of Class I and 63% of the compounds
   were over 15 years at the end of the study. This research added
   further evidence for genetic heterogeneity within the clinical
   syndrome, cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
