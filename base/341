	<abstract>The authors studied bronchial reactivity in children with cystic
   fibrosis and with deformative bronchitis. The reaction of the bronchi
   was studied both by inhalatory and exercise provocation. Inhalatory
   tests were monitored by means of a whole body plethysmograph. Free-
   range run was used for the exercise test, and the peak expiratory
   flow rate was measured. The described technique of inhalatory tests
   was accurate, safe, and not tiring for the patient. No distinct
   difference in bronchial reaction between the two groups of patients
   could be stated. The bronchial reaction to the inhalatory and
   exercise tests was stronger in both groups than in normals but not as
   strong as in asthmatics. The nature of bronchial hyperreactivity in
   those patients is still unknown. The inhalatory test seems to be more
   sensitive than the exercise test in detecting that hyperreactivity.</abstract>
