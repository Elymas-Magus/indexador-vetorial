	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis is a great unknown.  There is a lot of information
   about the disease, but no common denominator, nothing to pull all the
   pieces together.  It represents both a diagnostic and a therapeutic
   challenge.  Progress is being made and perhaps someday we will be
   able to understand this complex entity.</abstract>
