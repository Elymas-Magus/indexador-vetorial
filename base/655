	<abstract>We have previously demonstrated that cystic fibrosis (CF) cells show
   increased survival compared to normal cells when exposed to ouabain
   in medium lacking potassium.  In this report, we show that the CF
   cells bind significantly less ouabain than the normal cells in
   potassium-deficient medium.  Using age-matched normal and CF skin
   fibroblast strains, we show that (1) at ouabain concentrations &lt;
   20x10-9 M binding for both normal and CF cells is linear with time
   for 1 h and reaches equilibrium after 4 h; (2) at ouabain
   concentrations between 2 and 20x10-9 M, the initial rate of binding
   for CF cells is approx. 70% of the normal cells; (3) under
   equilibrium-binding conditions, Scatchard analysis reveals that
   three different CF strains have 12, 16, and 44% fewer
   ouabain-binding sites than their matched normal controls.  In
   addition, studies in potassium-free medium of the inhibition of
   86Rb flux (a K-plus analogue) into the cell by ouabain show no
   differences between CF and normal cells.  We have also previously
   shown that in a low glucose, potassium-deficient medium the CF cells
   survived ouabain exposure no better than normal cells.  In this
   report, equilibrium-binding studies with [3H]ouabain clearly show
   that CF cells bind less ouabain under these conditions than normal
   cells.  These results indicate that ouabain resistance in CF cells
   is not solely a function of differences in ouabain binding.
   Furthermore, the differential ouabain killing may not be due to ion
   transport differences, but rather to as yet unknown mechanisms.  CF
   cells thus appear to be unlike previously characterized
   ouabain-resistant mutants.</abstract>
