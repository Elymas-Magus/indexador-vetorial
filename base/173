	<abstract>By measuring potential difference between rectal mucosa and perianal
   skin using a reference electrode placed on the forearm, we
   demonstrated an altered potential difference in cystic children
   compared with control adults and normal children.  We suggested this
   might be due to an alteration in the rectal mucosa potential or
   altered skin potential, or both, in cystic fibrosis.  We measured
   skin and rectal charges directly by connecting our reference
   electrode to the blood stream through an intravenous line.  Using
   this technique we showed that the cystic fibrosis patients (C.F.)
   have an abnormal perianal skin potential difference compared with
   readings we obtained in normal children.  There was little
   difference in the transmural rectal potential difference between our
   cystic patients and previously reported values in normal adults.
   Thus the recent paper confirms our findings of normal polarity of
   the rectal mucosa surface and the increased skin polarisation in
   cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
