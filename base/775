	<abstract>Six patients with meconium ileus, in whom bowel resection and end-to-
   end anastomosis were performed, are presented. Meconium ileus may be
   simple or complicated. The simple form may be treated by Gastrografin
   enema. Surgery is indicated if conservative treatment fails and for
   patients with a complicated obstruction. Provided the bowel is
   disobstructed and carefully resected, end-to-end anastomosis is
   preferable. Confirmation of the diagnosis by careful histological
   examination of the resected bowel is urged.</abstract>
