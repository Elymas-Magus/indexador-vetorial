	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis is the commonest semilethal genetic disorder in
   Caucasians.  The biochemical sequence that leads to widespread
   dysfunction of exocrine glands has yet to be determined.  Cystic
   fibrosis in adults has been the subject of extensive review.  We
   still do not know the cause of the changes in the lungs.  Pancreatic
   insufficiency was recorded in 95% of the patients, but the older ones
   needed little dietary restriction and some seemed to thrive without
   pancreatic replacement.  Ninety-five per cent of males have aspermia
   due to failure of development of the vas deferens, epididymis, and
   seminal vesicles.  Despite the obvious handicap and emotional and
   social strains in all four series, adolescent and adult patients with
   cystic fibrosis not only did well at school and at work but managed
   to fit in well in their social framework.</abstract>
