	<abstract>Mr Rivers and Mr Hassam propose that the subnormal levels of
   linoleic acid (18:2) found in the plasma-phospholipids of patients
   with cystic fibrosis are due to malabsorption.  To substantiate
   their hypothesis they deduce that the remarkable remission observed
   in a cystic-fibrosis patient given intravenous &apos;Intralipid&apos; was due
   not to the 18:2 content of the 20% triglyceride component of the fat
   emulsion but to the 20:4 content of its 1.2% phospholipid component
   (not 6% as they state).  This explanation seems unlikely in view of
   the relatively small proportion of 20:4 in intralipid phospholipid,
   especially since intravenous administration of intralipid
   phospholipid to healthy subjects decreases both the 18:2 and 20:4
   content of their plasma-phospholipids.  Comparison of the effects of
   complete intralipid versus intralipid phospholipid on the level of
   20:4 in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis
   would soon determine whether they lack the ability to desaturate
   18:2 to 20:4.</abstract>
