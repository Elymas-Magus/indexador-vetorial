	<abstract>The autosomal recessively inherited disorder cystic fibrosis is
   clinically identified in patients by the pathognomonic finding of
   increased electrolyte content in the exocrine secretion sweat.  Two
   other observations merit mention.  First, the demonstration by Magos
   of the existence of a factor in CF sweat which interfered with
   reabsorption of sodium in the rat parotid.  Secondly is the existence
   of a CF serum component which interfered with ciliary rhythm in organ
   culture systems.  Our investigations in cystic fibrosis have been
   oriented towards the establishment of a possible pedigree of causes
   which will unite all these observations and secondly to develop a
   possible method for heterozygote detection.  Cystic fibrosis RNA is
   relatively undermethylated in comparison with contrast cultures.  In
   addition, CF heterozygote fibroblast cultures also appear
   undermethylated.  Our interpretation of these data do not imply a
   primary defect of RNA methylases in cystic fibrosis but rather
   suggested a defect elsewhere in biochemical sequences involving
   methionine.</abstract>
