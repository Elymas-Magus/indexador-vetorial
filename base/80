	<abstract>Study of the humoral antibody response of patients with cystic
   fibrosis to the heat-stable O (and possibly K) antigens of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that these antibodies in
   significant titers do not lead to eradication of the microorganism
   from the respiratory tract.  In three out of six patients,
   antibodies directed against the strains isolated from both sputum
   and the lungs at autopsy were present in elevated titers.  The
   antibody response to P. aeruginosa is strikingly affected by the
   condition of the host and differs in patients with cystic fibrosis
   or with one or another kind of malignancy.</abstract>
