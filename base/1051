	<abstract>We evaluted measurement of urinary 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid as a
   potential screening method for small-bowel disease and bacterial
   overgrowth syndromes in 360 unselected acutely ill infants and
   children. Control data were obtained on 120 healthy children, ages
   1.5 to 15 years, from a general medical practice, 48 healthy infants,
   ages one to five years, from local day nurseries, and 150 healthy
   babies, ages less than one to eight days. Comparative data were from
   300 acutely ill hospitalized babies and children, ranging in age from
   less than one day to 15 years and without clinical evidence for small-
   bowel disease and bacterial overgrowth syndrome. No false-negative
   results and only 2% false-positive results were observed. Among the
   10 patients whose urinary excretion of the analyte was considered to
   be abnormal were patients with Giardia lamblia infestation, ileal
   resection with blind loop, and other diseases of the small intestine
   associated with bacterial overgrowth. We conclude that measurement of
   4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid excretion is useful in screening for such
   diseases.</abstract>
