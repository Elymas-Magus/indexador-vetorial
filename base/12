	<abstract>Taussig et al reported a case of a 6-year-old boy with the Russell
   variant of the Silver-Russell syndrome concomitant with cystic
   fibrosis.  We would like to describe another patient who had the
   same combination of diseases.  The pattern of clinical findings in
   this patient are in accordance with that of the Silver-Russell
   syndrome.  It is, of course, possible that the development of
   cystic fibrosis in this patient is entirely accidental, although
   such a coincidence would be a statistically rare event.  The
   establishment of a possible relationship between these two
   conditions would depend on reports of other similar cases.</abstract>
