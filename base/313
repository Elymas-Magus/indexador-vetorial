	<abstract>Polyamine concentrations have been measured in blood samples from a
   series of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and control subjects.
   Analyses were made by a fluorometric method, in which the amines were
   reacted with dansyl chloride and separated by thin layer
   chromatography on Kieselguhr. There was no significant difference
   between the polyamine concentrations of blood samples from CF
   patients and control subjects. Also, the spermidine-spermine ratio
   was similar in both groups. Polyamines were also analyzed in exocrine
   fluids, and although none could be detected in either CF or control
   sweat or saliva, significant amounts of spermine and spermidine were
   present in all samples of bile and duodenal fluids. It thus seems
   likely that the biliary route is a significant pathway in the human
   for excretion of polyamines. The observation that polyamines are
   excreted in considerable concentrations via the bile in children may
   be of interest in view of the reports of elevated urinary polyamine
   concentrations in neoplastic states. Since measurable amounts of
   spermine and spermidine were detected in all six bile preparations
   available for this study, analysis of these substances in bile may be
   of benefit in particular cases.</abstract>
