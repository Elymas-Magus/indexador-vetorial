	<abstract>Dr. Soldin describes a method of collecting sweat for the diagnosis
   of cystic fibrosis which involves placing the patient on an electric
   blanket and wrapping him warmly for 2 - 5 hours until profuse
   sweating has occurred for 30 minutes.  One important omission from
   the title and the abstract is any mention of safety.  Children with
   cystic fibrosis may develop heat prostration when exposed to high
   temperatures, which may cause massive sodium and chloride losses via
   the sweat.  This could occur with the method described.  The
   apparatus described by Gibson and Cooke in the classic pilocarpine
   iontophoresis method of collecting sweat is neither overly
   sophisticated nor expensive.  It remains the method of choice,
   although attention to detail is important.</abstract>
