	<title>A positive approach to cystic fibrosis [editorial].</title>


	<source>Nurs-Mirror. 1978 Aug 24. 147(8). P 1.</source>

	<abstract>The child with cystic fibrosis presents a heart-breaking problem to
   parents, since the disease is inherited equally from both mother and
   father, and there is the possibility that other children will be
   similarly afflicted.  Perhaps the most valuable advice the nurse can
   give to parents is to adopt at all times a positive approach to their
   problem.</abstract>
