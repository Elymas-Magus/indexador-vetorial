	<abstract>Relatively little has been published on the parents&apos; ability to grasp
   the importance of empirical risk data and Mendelian-type
   probabilities.  The basic problem is that for many reasons, consumers
   do not know what the recurrent risks are for the various genetic
   diseases, not only cystic fibrosis.  As is so often the problem in
   health care, the most effective means to communicate health care
   information is not used or even known.  Until the problem of
   communication of probability can be worked out, I would like to make
   some suggestions in trying to help those who are provided with
   probability data.  Always record probability values discussed in the
   genetic counseling session.  If dealing with a family physician, the
   information should become a part of the medical history for future
   reference.  When providing documentation of probabilities, always
   include the interpretation of such probabilities through diagrams,
   charts, and other simple means.  Use available pamphlets and
   brochures provided by various organizations such as foundations and
   departments of health.</abstract>
