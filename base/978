	<abstract>In order to study the disposition which is thought to be latent in
   chronic pancreatitis, we investigated the sweat chloride
   concentration of 95 normal subjects, 43 cases of chronic
   pancreatitis, 12 cases of cholelithiasis, 15 cases of peptic ulcers,
   16 cases of hepatic diseases and 23 cases of diabetes mellitus with
   the sweat test, using the method of pilocarpine iontophoresis. We
   obtained the following results. (1) In normal subjects, the sweat
   chloride concentration was inclined to rise gradually with age from
   childhood to adulthood; the mean value of sweat chloride
   concentration was 30.0 mEq/liter in adults from 20 years old, and the
   upper limit was about 60 mEq/liter. (2) The mean value of sweat
   chloride concentration was 60.0 mEq/liter in chronic calcifying
   pancreatitis; this value was markedly higher than that of control
   subjects of the same age (p is less than 0.001). (3) The mean value
   of sweat chloride concentration in cholelithiasis, peptic ulcer and
   hepatic diseases did not differ significantly from control subjects.
   The mean value of sweat chloride concentration in diabetes mellitus
   was significantly higher than that of control subjects (p is less
   than 0.01), but was significantly lower than that in chronic
   pancreatitis (p is less than 0.01). (4) It was supposed that some
   cases of chronic pancreatitis have a congenital disposition toward
   abnormal secretion of sweat glands and epithelium in the pancreatic
   duct, resembling cystic fibrosis, and this disposition leads easily
   to pancreatic disorders when the individual is exposed to various
   external factors.</abstract>
