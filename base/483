	<abstract>Two reviews have questioned the value of meconium tests for the
   routine screening of cystic fibrosis because of the high proportion
   of false-positive and (perhaps more importantly) false-negative
   results.  We wish to report our findings on false-negative results.
   We are evaluating various methods of meconium screening including the
   Boehringer Mannheim test strip, a semiquantitative test for proteins,
   electroimmunoassay of albumin, and estimation of the
   albumin/alpha1-antirypsin ratio.  The figures are too small to draw
   any conclusions between the apparent relationship of false-negative
   results and a family history of the disease, but we feel that the
   results illustrate that little reliance should be put on a negative
   meconium test.  This is not to say that the meconium test is
   valueless.  In our study, at least 40% of infants with cystic
   fibrosis had a positive meconium-test result but did not have
   meconium ileus and thus the possibility of cystic fibrosis in these
   infants was recognised within a few days after birth and usually well
   before definitive clinical signs of the disease were manifest.</abstract>
