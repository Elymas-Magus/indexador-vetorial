	<abstract>Dr Hosli and Mrs Hosli reported that differential thermolability of
   plasma alpha-mannosidase and plasma acid phosphatase allowed
   discrimination between normal people, cystic fibrosis carriers, and
   patients.  We have repeated these experiments, paying special
   attention to the technical details given in the Hoslis&apos;s paper.  In a
   separate series of experiments we used larger volumes of plasma for
   each assay, which was performed either with or without
   non-fluorescent paraffin oil.  In both cases the blood samples were
   processed exactly as outlined in Hosli and Vogt&apos;s paper.  There were
   no significant differences in the heat stability of plasma
   alpha-mannosidase and acid phosphatase between the three groups.</abstract>
