	<abstract>Adolescents with cystic fibrosis were compared with normal
   adolescents of the same age and educational grade on several measures
   of vocational development and adjustment. The cystic fibrosis group
   in ages 12--16 and in grades 7, 8, and 9 scored lower than their
   normal counterparts in measures of vocational and educational plans,
   and were less realistic than normals in considering their limitations
   and financial constraints. In contrast, the cystic fibrosis group at
   nearly all age and grade levels scored significantly higher on
   strength of commitment to vocational choice, work values, and
   awareness of occupational information. Compared to 4 additional
   handicapped groups already studied, adolescents with cystic fibrosis
   scored favorably. They not only plan to work but also hold strong
   work values compared to normals. Rehabilitation programs should
   emphasize preparation for a career and the development of educational
   and vocational plans while the adolescent is still in high school.</abstract>
