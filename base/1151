	<abstract>We explored 44 children suffering from cystic fibrosis with
   predominant pulmonary involvement and followed in particular the
   course of illness of 30 of these patients during an average period of
   4 years.  We were impressed by the enormous variability of the
   pulmonary symptomatology in these children.  The question arose
   whether this clinical impression is supported by the finding of the
   thorax radiograph and the results of the lung functions tests and the
   blood gas measures at rest and on exercise.  From the clinical point
   of view, there is a possibility to make a classification of severity
   in pulmonary aspects of this disease.  Because of the large ranges of
   the score values a clear distinction of the severity could only be
   possible if large groups of patients were to be compared.  For the
   interindividual comparison the cumulative evaluation of a clinical
   score, the chest radiograph and the lung function tests are
   indispensable.  Only the continuous follow-up of these examinations
   allows one to notice, in time, a progressive lung involvement with
   its degenerative changes.</abstract>
