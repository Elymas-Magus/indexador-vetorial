	<abstract>The survival rates in 204 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis
   observed between January 1956 and June 1976 were recorded. The
   patients were divided into five groups according to the symptoms
   present at the time of diagnosis and survival rates were recorded
   separately for each group. Survival was less good in the group of
   patients presenting initially with pulmonary symptoms compared to the
   group presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. In the group
   presenting with meconium ileus survival was poor initially, but later
   in the course of the disease it became similar to that observed in
   the other groups. The differences in survival between the different
   categories occurred during the first two years after diagnosis. The
   study shows that, on clinical grounds, a severe form of the disease
   which is characterized by early manifestation of pulmonary symptoms
   and poor survival can be distinguished from a more protracted form
   with a better survival. Because of the great inter-individual
   variability large numbers of patients will have to be evaluated in
   order to achieve statistically significant results in studies which
   attempt to compare different therapeutic approaches. If such numbers
   cannot be reached, it may be necessary to compare only patients who
   belong to the same symptomatic category.</abstract>
