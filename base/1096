	<abstract>Attempts to identify the carrier state for cystic fibrosis (CF) or to
   make a prenatal diagnosis of CF have been unsuccessful.  One approach
   to this problem is to look for associations between known genetic
   markers and the locus for CF.  In general these studies have looked
   at the frequency of HLA types in patients with CF and have failed to
   demonstrate a strong association.  We attempted to look for linkage
   between HLA haplotypes and CF in families with more than one affected
   member.  The segregation of HLA in these affected sibpairs vary
   little from the expected.  Although the sample size is small, it is
   unlikely that a close linkage exists between the HLA loci and the CF
   locus.</abstract>
