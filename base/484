	<abstract>In an effort to determine whether increased permeability to calcium
   ions could explain the cystic fibrosis-serum ciliary dyskensia factor
   response in the tracheal test system, we selectively increased the
   membrane permeability of the tracheal epithelium to calcium ions by
   adding calcium ionophore A23187 to the tracheal culture medium.
   These studies determined that calcium ionophore A23187 in culture
   medium produced a change in mucociliary function in the tracheal test
   system indistinguishable from that promoted by C.F. sera.  These
   investigations, which are now being extended to include the
   ultrastructural alterations induced in the epithelium of the rabbit
   tracheal bioassay system, point to an important role for calcium as a
   cofactor in the production of the C.D.F. response generated by the
   C.F sera.  The C.F. serum substance seems to act at the
   cellular-membrane level, promoting membrane-permeability changes (at
   least with respect to calcium) in the rabbit tracheal test system.
   Such a mechanism would not necessarily result in a net physiological
   imbalance of calcium in the rabbit tracheal system but only local
   changes in calcium concentration that would subsequently alter
   secretion and microtubular function.  Since C.F. serum, like sweat
   and saliva from these same patients, can promote ionic fluxes,
   perhaps there is a common factor in all these body-fluids which is
   related to the basic defect in C.F.  It is tempting to speculate that
   such a factor produces a membrane-associated phenomenon that may be
   generally representative of the in-vivo C.F. disorder and as such may
   reflect the nature of the cellular and glandular abnormalities of the
   disease.</abstract>
