	<title>Screening for cystic fibrosis--further thoughts [editorial].</title>


	<source>Med-J-Aust. 1976 Aug 7. 2(6). P 194-5.</source>

	<abstract>Screening of the newborn for genetically determined diseases is one
   thing when sought by parents who know they are likely to pass a
   defective gene to their offspring; it is another thing altogether to
   apply screening tests to all newborns, irrespective of individual
   risks.  In Australia, in the foreseeable future, the best hope for
   infants and children born with cystic fibrosis lies in the
   application of the proven sweat test technique whenever any of the
   numerous presenting features of the disease crops up.</abstract>
