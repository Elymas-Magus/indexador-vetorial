	<abstract>In this study, the potential problems and discrepancies in cill
   culture techniques were avoided by isolating leukocytes from the
   peripheral blood of patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy human
   volunteers and preparing homogenates to determine the specific
   activities of 5 lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradation of
   glycoproteins. Four lysosomal hydrolases involved in the breakdown of
   the carbohydrate side chain were assayed using artificial substrates.
   The fifth enzyme, aspartylglucosamine amido hydrolase, which cleaves
   the linkage between this side chain and the peptide backbone, was
   assayed with natural substrate. No differences in enzyme activities
   between the 2 leukocyte sources were observed. Because no enzyme
   activities were deficient and no compensatory increases were noted,
   we concluded that the thick, glycoprotein-rich, exocrine secretions
   in cystic fibrosis cannot be attributed to a defect in their
   catabolism.</abstract>
