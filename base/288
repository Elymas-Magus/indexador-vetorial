	<abstract>In an investigation of the effects of intestinal malabsorption on
   plasma-lipids, we compared the fatty-acid composition of the
   serum-lecithin of 23 patients with malabsorption from a variety of
   different causes and found similar changes irrespective of the
   underlying cause of the malabsorption.  The only exception to this
   was that classical E.F.A. deficiency was found only in patients
   whose malabsorption was due to massive small-bowel resection.  All
   other causes of malabsorption gave rise to changes identical to
   those found by other workers in C.F.; there is thus no reason to
   postulate an additional metabolic abnormality specific to C.F.  The
   relatively normal amounts of arachidonic acid reported in some
   E.F.A. deficient patients may not be entirely due to arachidonic
   acid.</abstract>
