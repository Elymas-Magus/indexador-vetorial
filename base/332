	<abstract>The emotional distress associated with cystic fibrosis is
   considerable.  From the moment of diagnosis, delayed or not, the
   parents&apos; problems multiply and for the most part these problems are
   at first only vaguely comprehended.  Many parents embark on the long
   haul of caring for their child in almost total ignorance of the
   disease and its implications.  The fact that the disease is inherited
   is of outstanding importance to the parents.  The basis of genetic
   counseling in the disease is the explanation of recessive
   inheritance.  Even when genetic counseling has been given effectively
   and the parents have decided to have no further children, the family
   planning problem is not yet solved.  The physiotherapist is also
   necessarily concerned with the emotional state and behaviour of the
   child.  Except in the latest stages of this disease the child&apos;s
   emotional distress is not directly related to the discomfort of his
   symptoms.  Over-protection by parents is understandable but it is
   important to persuade them that it is undesirable.  Perhaps the most
   difficult questions of protection arise in relation to the child&apos;s
   knowledge of his own disorder.  Cystic fibrosis is a miserable
   disease and the cause of much distress, emotional and otherwise.</abstract>
