	<abstract>Minocycline hydrochloride was given to 100 patients with cystic
   fibrosis of the pancreas for periods of 3 months over a broad-
   spectrum antibiotic drug rotation which lasted 2 years. Increased
   weight gain and some clinical improvement was seen during treatment
   with minocycline. Those patients with severe disease gained more
   weight than those with mild or moderate disease, and males gained
   more than females. When minocycline hydrochloride was not the drug in
   use, patients lost weight and their health declined.</abstract>
