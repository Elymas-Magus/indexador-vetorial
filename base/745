	<abstract>Pulmonary clearance for Staphylococcus aureus has been examined in
   two inbred strains of mice with some hereditary alterations
   resembling cystic fibrosis (CF).  These mice were mice with abnormal
   electrolyte metabolism (DBA/@J-cri), mice with spontaneous
   pneumonitis (C57BL/6J-bg), and mice without any CF-like alterations
   (BALB/c).  The methods used to produce pulmonary infection were
   essentially those of Laurenzi and associates adapted as needed for
   mutant mice.  The animals mentioned above were exposed to a finely
   divided aerosol suspension of a coagulase-positive strain of S.
   aureus in phosphate buffer.  Immediately after the exposure, half of
   the animals were killed, and the remaining half were killed 4 hr
   later.  In each experimental unit the mice killed immediately after
   the exposure were as similar as possible to the mice killed 4 hr
   later with respect to genotype, age, and sex; some were siblings.
   The uncleared bacteria (UBR) in 4 hr were 0.20 for the mice without
   any CF-like alterations (BALB/c) and the C57BL/6J-bg, bg/bg
   genotypes; 0.28 for C57BL/6J-bg, +/? genotypes; 0.50 for the
   DBA/2J-cri, +/? genotypes; and 0.56 for cri/cri mice.  The number of
   viable staphylococci found immediately after the aerosol exposure
   (Co) in the C57BL/6J-bg strain is significantly lower than the Co of
   the BALB/c (P &lt; 0.05) and DBA/2J-cri strain (P &lt; 0.01).  The latter
   two did not differ from each other.  There was no sex difference
   with respect to the UBR and Co data.  The DBA/2J-cri strain of mice,
   where the cri mutation first appeared, has a decreased capacity for
   clearance of S. aureus by the lung.  Together with the other CF-like
   alterations of the cri mutation, namely failure for the reabsorption
   of Na+ by the parotid duct, high level of Na+ in the fur, and CF
   abnormal serum factor activity in the serum of the cri/cri mice, we
   suggest that the cribriform degeneration mouse mutant may provide a
   potential animal model for studying CF.  The finding of a mouse
   mutation with electrolyte alterations and CF-like abnormal serum
   activity, simialr to the activity found in CF children, in an inbred
   strain of mice with a decreased bacterial clearance by the lungs,
   makes these mice very useful for CF studies.</abstract>
