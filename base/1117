	<abstract>We have also found a significant difference between the 6-hour
   urinary PABA recovery in healthy controls and CF patients, with no
   overlap of the ranges, and a good correlation with fecal chymotrypsin
   activity.  We can stress the usefulness of the test in this age
   group.  In studying a group of healthy newborn infants, however, the
   results were quite different: The PABA recovery was smaller and
   showed greater variations and overlap with results in CF patients
   occurred.  It is clear that the test is not applicable in newborn
   infants when performed in the described manner.  One possible
   explanation is the physiologically limited glomerular filtration rate
   in the newborn infant, which could have delayed the PABA excretion.</abstract>
