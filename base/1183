	<abstract>Gordeuk et al. state that cystic fibrosis may be first diagnosed in
   adulthood, but we feel that a condition with such grave genetic and
   prognostic implications must be diagnosed with special caution in
   this age group.  In particular, the sweat test, which is the main
   diagnostic tool for use with children, must be interpreted in adults
   in the light of possible age-related increases in normal
   sweat-electrolyte concentration and other factors that may affect the
   assay.  Although it is generally accepted that &quot;normal&quot; sweat sodium
   and chloride concentrations are higher in adults than in children,
   there is no clear agreement about the upper limits of the normal
   range in adults.  The volume of sweat produced during the test may
   also have a substantial effect on electrolyte values.  For the
   diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults, an attempt should thus be
   made to base the diagnosis not only on &quot;elevated&quot; sweat-electrolyte
   values and clinical impression but also on pancreatic-function data.</abstract>
