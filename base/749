	<abstract>The cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia activities
   (CDA) in sera from CF homozygotes, heterozygote carriers, and
   individuals with bronchial asthma have been partially purified.
   Concurrently, the CDA&apos;s in sera from patients with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) or bronchial asthma were shown to be different substances by ion-
   exchange or gel permeation chromatographic procedures. Sephadex G-200
   chromatography indicated that the CF-CDA eluted with a protein
   fraction of molecular weight (MW) 68,000-150,000 and that the asthma
   CDA was found in a protein fraction of MV greater than 150,000. The
   two activities could also be separated by DEAE-cellulose
   chromatography. Prior acidification of whole normal, CF homozygote,
   obligate heterozygote, or asthmatic sera to pH 3.7 using EDTA,
   followed by fractionation of Sephadex G-200 removed all the CDA&apos;s
   from fractions of highermolecular  weight and shifted the activities
   to a protein fraction of MW 1,100-13,700. This procedure afforded a
   200-fold purification of the CDA&apos;s in sera from patients with asthma
   or CF. EDTA treatment, however, also generated a CDA in previously
   nonreactive normal sera. Subsequent fractionation of the various
   active G-200 fractions on Bio-Gel P10 allowed for the separation of
   three separate activities (Bio-Gel Fractions I, II-IV, and V).
   Fraction I was shown to represent the activity in sera from patients
   with asthma and was determined to be C3a (MW 9,000). Fraction I was
   also found in normal, CF, and carrier sera and therefore is not a
   specific CDA. Fraction II-IV is thought to represent a CF-specific
   CDA (MW 5,000) since it could not be demonstrated in either normal or
   asthmatic sera but was found in sera of obligate heterozygotes.
   Fraction III-IV also did not react with antisera to human C3a.
   Fraction V was generated from all serum types upon acidification of
   the serum with EDTA and is thought to be a nonspecific CDA. Bio-Gel
   P10 filtration of Sephadex G-200 fractions provided 823-fold and 650-
   fold purification of the asthmatic and CF CDA&apos;s, respectively.
   Concurrent analysis of column fractions for CDA&apos;s by bioassay and for
   CFP by electrofocusing showed CFP only in fractions that contained
   the CF-CDA. Combined analyses employing acid disc gel
   electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and EDTA treatment of active
   CF-immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Sephadex G-200 column fractions,
   followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography, provided evidence that CFP
   was associated with the CF-CDA. It is unknown as yet whether CFP
   itself is responsible for the CF-CDA activity.</abstract>
