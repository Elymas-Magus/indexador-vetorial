	<abstract>Respiratory infections in infants and children cause much ill-health
   and also an appreciable mortality.  They are found at times in most
   school-children and in infants, especially those in large families
   and those living in poor circumstances.  In all respiratory
   infections the whole respiratory tract is involved.  For descriptive
   purposes it is useful to divide these infections into upper
   respiratory-tract infections, in which the infection is
   predominantly at the larynx or above; and lower respiratory-tract
   infections, in which the predominant infection is below the larynx.
   Acute upper respiratory-tract infections are usually viral and the
   poly-virus infection of coryza is the commonest.  Acute lower
   respiratory-tract infections are discussed in two groups: in infants
   under two years of age and in children over two (including cystic
   fibrosis).</abstract>
