	<abstract>Cystic Fibrosis is a generalized hereditary disorder of children,
   adolescents, and young adults in which there is widespread
   dysfunction of mucus-secreting glands.  The patient&apos;s condition may
   be characterized by one or all of the following: chronic pulmonary
   disease, pancreatic enzyme deficiency and abnormally high sweat
   electrolytes.  Hence, each patient is treated on an individual basis.
   Parents tied to a rigid regime imposed by the disease must have help;
   volunteers are needed to support and assist them at home and at
   school.  Cystic Fibrosis still needs a lot of help, and knowledge
   and understanding on the part of the nursing profession helps a great
   deal.</abstract>
