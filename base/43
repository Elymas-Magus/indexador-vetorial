	<abstract>The effects of cystic fibrosis on 50 Victorian families with one or
   more affected children were examined in a study carried out between
   August 1972 and February 1973.  The social and emotional problems
   experienced by family members, particularly the patients and
   mothers, are reported on.  At all ages, socially embarrassing
   symptoms and awareness of being different create major problems for
   the patient.  The uncertainty of prognosis and doubts about the
   prospects of employment are specially relevant for the teenager.
   It is suggested that the patient be given ample opportunity, from
   early adolescence onward, to discuss all aspects of his disease,
   and that more appropriate provision should be made for the total
   care of adult patients.  Many problems, such as depression, feelings
   of isolation and the physical demands of constant treatment, which
   the parents of children with cystic fibrosis experience, are
   probably similar to those confronting parents of other chronically
   ill and handicapped children.  But special difficulties stem from
   the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis and from the knowledge of an
   eventually fatal outcome.  The roles of professional members of the
   medical team are touched on, particularly in relation to genetic
   counseling and the provision of practical and emotional support to
   parents.  Comments are made on the establishment of lay
   organisations.  The financial strain associated with obtaining
   regular medical attention was looked at, and suggestions are made
   for minimizing the economic problems of certain vulnerable families.</abstract>
