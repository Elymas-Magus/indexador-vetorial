	<title>Letter: Management of children with cystic fibrosis.</title>

	<abstract>Reports of children with cystic fibrosis living well whilst on
   intensive treatment can be covered by allegations that their disease
   must be basically mild.  More revealing evidence comes from the
   longterm survival studies done by Professor Warren Warwick, of the
   University of Minnesota.  The introduction of antibiotics have
   allowed the children to live loner, but 3/4 were dead by aged 10
   years.  Physiotherapy given after infections prolonged lives so that
   half were still alive at 10 years - but still faced a relentless
   death rate.  Prophylactic - daily - physiotherapy produced a
   doubling of survival at 20 years from under 30% to over 60%.  I do
   not deny for a moment that daily physiotherapy with inhalations is a
   great strain on the family, but it is not as great as the strain of
   watching the slow and relentless decline of the child which, with
   racking cough and persistent dyspnoea, is anything but peaceful.</abstract>
