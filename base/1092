	<abstract>Although N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Mucomyst) is an effective mycolytic,
   numerous investigations have failed to demonstrate a consistent
   improvement in pulmonary mechanics following its use. In order to
   determine whether its beneficial mucolytic activity might be
   counterbalanced by a deleterious direct effect on cilia, we studied
   its effect on the activity of ciliated epithelium in the ferret
   tracheal organ culture system. N-acetyl-L-cysteine consistently
   caused progressive time-dependent ciliostasis at concentrations
   clinically employed, with complete ciliary paralysis within 8 hr. The
   effect was only partially reversed by the removal of the drug.
   Control preparations retained full ciliary activity for 3 to 12
   weeks. In order to determine the active site on the N-acetyl-L-
   cysteine molecule, we investigated the ciliostatic effects of five of
   its chemical analogs. Isomolar N-acetyl-L-alanine was not
   ciliostatic, indicating the necessity of a sulfhydryl group for
   activity. Ciliostasis was independent of isomeric structure,
   acetylation, and chain length, as evidenced by the similar
   ciliostatic effects of L-cysteine, D-cysteine, 2-mercaptoethylamine,
   and N-acetyl-L-homocysteine. We conclude that N-acetyl-L-cysteine
   induces partially reversible ciliostasis of tracheal epithelium via
   its sulfhydryl group; prolonged use of this drug may impair
   mucociliary clearance.</abstract>
