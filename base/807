	<abstract>To test whether the month of birth of patients with cystic fibrosis
   (CF) is seasonally distributed as reported in a Dutch survey,
   published Australian data were examined and no difference in the
   monthly variation was found between births of CF patients and their
   unaffected sibs. When the two groups were combined and analysed by
   periodic regression using successively higher Fourier terms, a
   significant fit to the observed frequencies was obtained with a
   bimodal curve. Possession of a single CF gene seems therefore
   sufficient for expression of the cyclic variation. In substantial
   agreement with the Dutch series, maximum frequencies were found to
   occur in March or April and in September. It is suggested that one or
   both parents may be subject to variable fertility mediated by a
   temperature-dependent mechanism. The relevance of a periodic
   fertility pattern in preserving the CF gene in the population by
   selective heterozygote advantage is discussed.</abstract>
