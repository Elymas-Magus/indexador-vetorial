	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) was firmly established as a single disease by
   Anderson in 1938 although previously case reports had appeared in
   the European literature.  Subsequently C.F. has been described in
   many parts of the world.  This is the first report of cystic
   fibrosis in Arab-Iraqi children.  Seventeen cases of cystic fibrosis
   were diagnosed at Medical City Teaching College Hospital, University
   of Baghdad, between 1970 and 1976.  In this study the sex-ratio was
   2:1.  This compared with the roughly equal ratio usually quoted.  A
   possible explanation for this discrepancy is the preference given to
   boys in Iraqi families and medical attention is more likely to be
   sought on their behalf.</abstract>
