	<abstract>Serum ciliotoxic activity (SCA), which had been described in cystic
   fibrosis (CF), was studied in mutant mice with some hereditary
   alterations resembling this inherited disease. A test was developed
   to detect SCA in biologic fluids by means of a natural vibratile
   system; it consisted in the incubation of mouse sperm with different
   CF serum dilutions under controlled conditions, in order to determine
   the sperm translation cessation time (STCT) and the sperm activity
   cessation time (SACT). As the findings of this study were similar to
   those obtained by other authors who have been employing alternative
   systems, it was decided to apply this method on mice serum. Sera were
   obtained from male and female 3- to 4-wk-old mice of DBA/2J-cri,
   C57BL/6J-bgJ, and BALB/c inbred strains; SCA was investigated in
   affected homozygotes and their +/? siblings were used as controls.
   Male 8- to 16-wk-old BALB/c mice were employed as sperm donors.
   Significant differences were found between cri/cri and +/? mice of
   the DBA/2J-cri strain in both STCT and SACT determinations at 1/10
   serum dilution. It is concluded that mouse sperm is a system
   sensitive enough to detect SCA in biologic fluids from human beings.
   Likewise, the test of the mouse sperm allowed us to detect SCA in
   cri/cri mice, turning this mutation into a possible animal model for
   CF.</abstract>
