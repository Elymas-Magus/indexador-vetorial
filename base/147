	<title>Letter: Rates and calcium concentrations of sweat in relation to
   cystic fibrosis.</title>

	<abstract>The authors of the recent article which failed to show a
   significant difference between sweat calcium concentrations of CF
   patients and control subjects, suggest that the findings refute our
   hyperpermeability hypothesis.  They found sweat Ca of 0.32 to 1.67
   mEq/liter in 26 control subjects and 0.42 to 2.03 mEq/liter in 16
   CF patients.  With these tremendous ranges many more subjects would
   be required to prove or disprove a difference.  A difference
   undetectable in a moderate number of subjects is probably not of
   pathophysiologic significance if the Ca really varies
   unpredictably.  Sweat Ca, however, is generally believed to vary
   with the rate of sweating, being much higher at lower rates, and
   measurements made at comparable rates might well show significant
   differences.  The authors did attempt to control rate, but in a
   very inappropriate manner.  They measured no constant rate, but
   took the average rate during the 30 minutes immediately after
   iontophoresis.  This gives little information concerning the rate
   at which the sweat was actually produced.</abstract>
