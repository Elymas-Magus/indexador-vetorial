	<abstract>When a genic disorder is only manifest if there are offending
   alleles at both loci, as in fibrocystic disease, there is a loss of
   two abnormal alleles with each affected birth since the homozygotes
   rarely reproduce.  How is this loss compensated?  How could some
   50,000 alleles, which can only survive to convey themselves in
   effective gametes if they have a normal allelic partner, become
   established in the British Isles - and how have some half a million
   or more got into the world currency?  First, migrations and
   settlements involve the proportion of defective alleles at all loci
   being conserved, but their variety being increased.  Secondly, there
   could be a general tendency due to some advantage in health or
   vitality, which could be manifest by disease resistance, cold
   resistance, and by any number of physical or psychological
   mechanisms.  Thirdly, there may be &apos;compensation&apos; - that is the
   death of an infant may lead to replacement as a result of which the
   replacing sib, if surviving, would have a 2/3 chance of being a
   carrier.  Fourthly, the disease may be maintained by mutation.  Of
   the four possibilities, three are unrealistic, so that substantial
   selective advantage of heterozygotes over the last few hundred years
   must be postulated.</abstract>
