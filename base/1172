	<abstract>To study the parotid gland function in children with cystic fibrosis
   we investigated parotid saliva specimens of 18 such patients.  We
   compared the results with a control group of 12 healthy children of
   the same age and sex.  Furthermore, children with bronchial asthma
   and chronic bronchitis were examined.  The flow rate of the parotid
   and the protein output without stimulation were nearly the same for
   the four groups.  In patients with CF the protein output after
   stimulation was significantly lower.  An increased level of sodium
   was observed in the stimulated secretion and the unstimulated saliva
   as well.  In CF children we found a significant higher output of
   sodium in both stimulated parotid saliva and unstimulated parotid
   saliva.  The IgG output of the gland after stimulation was found to
   be slightly reduced in patients with CF in comparison to healthy
   children.  The output of the gland for IgA after stimulation was
   observed to be strongly reduced for the group with CF and for the
   group with bronchial asthma.  The decreased output of the gland for
   secretory IgA after stimulation was demonstrated again in CF and in
   bronchial asthma in comparison with healthy persons.  The increased
   sodium concentration in parotid saliva may be caused in a similar way
   as the electrolyte abnormality of sweat in CF patients, namely by a
   decreased net reabsorption of sodium.  Due to the result of an
   increased electrolyte output and decreased immunoglobulin output of
   parotid gland we can suppose that the molecular magnitude plays its
   role in this disturbance.</abstract>
