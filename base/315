	<abstract>There has been a recent trend to treating more and more pediatric
   patients with chronic diseases on an ambulatory basis.  This is true
   of both hemophilia and cystic fibrosis.  Despite their success in
   keeping slightly more than two thirds of their patients out of the
   hospital, I think that they might be more successful in the future if
   the following points are considered.  First, many of those initially
   selected for intravenous medications due to their nonresponsiveness
   to oral therapy and again later considered failures of intravenous
   treatment might actually be noncompliers.  My second point concerns
   the lack of follow-up within the patient&apos;s home.  It would seem to me
   that this would be an ideal place for a public health nurse to check
   on the patient&apos;s condition, ensure that the procedure was being
   properly followed under actual field conditions, and that the correct
   amount of medicine has been utilized. - Dr. David&apos;s letter regarding
   potential problems of noncompliance and home follow-up in the use of
   outpatient intravenous antibiotics points out the need for this type
   of therapy to be instituted only in those centers in which these
   facets can be well controlled. Public health nurses are utilized by
   some centers to supervise and assist in the home management of cystic
   fibrosis with good success.</abstract>
