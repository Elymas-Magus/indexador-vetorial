	<abstract>We examined white cell cultures from 45 parents of CF patients (ie,
   compulsory heterozygotes) to confirm if possible the existence of
   an ametachromatic group (class III0 and the quantitate this class
   in relation to the numbers of heterozygotes showing vesicular
   cytoplasmic metachromasia (class I0 and generalized metachromasia
   (class II).  Leucocyte cultures from the 45 CF carriers were set up
   in parallel with similar cultures from 45 normal healthy controls.
   The results confirm the value of the Toluidine Blue O metachromasia
   phenomenon in white cell cultures as a method for heterozygote
   detection in cystic fibrosis and suggest that it may be justified
   to replace the tedious, expensive and time-consuming fibroblast
   technique with the much simpler and more rapid leukocyte culture
   procedure.  The simplicity and apparent reliability of the
   leukocyte culture procedure as outlined here should facilitate
   intrafamilial investigation and co-ordination of metachromasia
   class with other parameters such as sweat electrolytes, ciliary
   dyskinetic factor and clinical manifestations.  Such a study, if it
   revealed distinct and consistent phenotypic correlations, might
   furnish valuable additional evidence for genetic heterogeneity in
   cystic fibrosis.</abstract>
