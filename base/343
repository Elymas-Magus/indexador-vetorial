	<abstract>Cystic fibrosis, sometimes known as mucoviscidosis, is a generalised
   disorder of the exocrine glands which affects children, adolescents
   and young adults.  No biochemical abnormality may be regarded as the
   primary cause, although at various times it has been suggested that
   the defect lies in ion transport, in glycoprotein structure or in
   membrane permeability.  Cystic fibrosis is inherited as a Mendelian
   recessive, and is the commonest of all such genetic diseases in the
   Caucasoid populations of Western Europe and North America.  Super
   has detected and documented a frequency of the disease among
   Caucasoids in South West Africa which is considerably higher than
   that found anywhere else in the world.  An investigation of the ways
   in which the disease in South West Africa may differ, clinically or
   pathologically, from that found elsewhere, is necessary.</abstract>
