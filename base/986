	<abstract>Serum and sputum sol phase from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF)
   were examined for occurrence and titres of precipitins against
   Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus by means of crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel. The patients had from
   four to nine H. influenzae precipitins in serum and in most cases
   fewer precipitins in sputum, but, on an average, there was no
   difference between the titres of the antibodies in serum and sputum.
   Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species,
   notably those of the Haemophilus genus. S. aureus precipitins were
   generally found in higher numbers in serum than in sputum, but, on an
   average, the titre of the precipitins in sputum was higher than in
   serum. Three of the precipitins were detectable only in sputum and
   not in serum, and one of these is a S. aureus-specific precipitin.
   Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species, and
   these antibodies were often present in sputum in much higher titres
   than in the corresponding sera. Antibodies against teichoic acid of
   the S. aureus cell wall could not be demonstrated in sputum, while
   they were present in 22 sera. The possible role of the local
   pulmonary humoral immune response in protective immunity and in the
   pathology of the lung disease in CF is discussed.</abstract>
